TLDR: Ali Larsen aka Gross Gore, a UK Twitch streamer, has: asked a 15 year old girl to expose her breasts on a group video call, groomed and solicited pictures from minors, made fun of the victim along with his community, sexually harassed and assaulted women (even other Twitch streamers), bragged about sleeping with a 16 year old, sent revenge porn to a victim‚Äôs mother, used racial and homophobic slurs on and offline, makes heavily misogynistic comments when rejected, etc. This is not a call to cancel him, but rather, a call for help when it comes to get answers from Twitch as to why people like this are not only allowed on their platform, but also protected. If anyone knows someone that could help please leave a comment or DM me.

---

Chapter I: Background

Originally a Runescape YouTuber, Ali moved on to Twitch to stream League of Legends. He was indefinitely banned in 2016 for calling a League caster a pedophile with baseless accusations, as well as being banned from attending League of Legends events for a year. For some reason, Twitch unbanned him in 2017 but was banned for 30 days in 2018 for sexually harassing multiple women at Jagex‚Äôs gaming convention ‚ÄúRunefest‚Äù. His actions even caused a fight outside of the event where police were involved. Now acting like a ‚Äúreformed‚Äù person, Ali continues his Twitch ventures where any criticism of him and his past is shut down.

---

Chapter II: Coming to Light

I had heard of Ali in the past due to my participation in Twitch, but I didn‚Äôt know about his sexually unhinged behaviour until November of 2020, when someone came forward and said that [she had been groomed by Ali in 2015 at the age of 16, while he was 24](https://imgur.com/a/7k8EOcn). This person showed Snapchat conversations between the two where she says that she was attending college (which in the UK means the person would typically be 16, 17 or 18) and later specified she was 16, but that didn‚Äôt stop him from soliciting pictures. In other statements, she says that they eventually had a Skype conversation, but quickly turned sexual and promptly ended. Because of this information going public, the victim later revealed that Ali‚Äôs community harassed and even doxed her in his Discord server, where they would share information such as name, general location and more pictures. Not only that, but to this day, [Ali and his community continue to ridicule the victim by using the term ‚Äúpic xx‚Äù to joke amongst them](https://imgur.com/a/WISEtQ7), which is what Ali said when soliciting pictures from the minor.

Shortly after, I was made aware of a community partially dedicated to bring awareness when it comes to Ali‚Äôs previous questionable actions. I was exposed to more information regarding him. It was then that I discovered the real person behind the computer screen.

---

Chapter III: The Crimes

This is a list of some of his known actions, some involving minors, when he was already an adult, as well as general sexual harassment. I will refer to people as ‚Äúminors‚Äù since they were younger than 18 at the time of Ali‚Äôs interactions with them, as there could be some cultural differences when it comes to age.

* [When he was 18, Ali explains how he pressured a 15 year old girl into exposing her breasts for a Tinychat video call with multiple people \(70+\)](https://youtu.be/ACu1LQNpXBI). His defense is that he didn‚Äôt know her age but was later informed by others, who called him a pedophile for doing so. Is it really that hard to tell when someone might be ‚Äútoo young‚Äù to pressure them into doing something like this?

* [When he was 24, he made a Facebook bragging about sleeping with a 16 year old girl](https://youtu.be/4U6yluVtd_0). Now, since the age of consent in the UK is 16 you might ask ‚ÄúOk, so it‚Äôs legal. What‚Äôs the problem?‚Äù. Although personally I do not agree with this since it‚Äôs predatory as hell to prey on people of barely legal age, some may say that it‚Äôs legally ok to do so. So, is it morally ok to sleep with 13 year olds in Japan or 12 year olds in the Philippines? Food for thought.

* At some point he started a relationship with a 17 year old girl from the USA. To make things short, after they broke up, the girl started selling revealing pictures on Patreon and promoting them on Twitter with some free content. [Ali took it upon himself to gather as many pictures and videos as possible to then send them to her mother, letting her know what she was doing online](https://imgur.com/a/jk80UB4). As per the definition of ‚ÄúRevenge Porn‚Äù, what Ali did was and still is illegal, yet nothing was done by Twitch once this started circulating.

* He is now permanently banned from attending Jagex events (the company behind Runescape, the game where he first grew to popularity) for harassing multiple women, one of which spoke out and another person jumped to her defense, causing a disturbance outside the event. [He made disgusting, unsolicited comments about a woman‚Äôs attire](https://youtu.be/R-jfENsoVkk), [forced a kiss onto another woman](https://streamable.com/n8h9eu), [and starts crawling towards another woman‚Äôs butt when he had a camera pointing at him](https://streamable.com/nqvmf). Jagex was quick to permanently ban the guy, but apparently this was only a slap on the wrist from Twitch, as he only received a 30 day ban from the platform despite having already been indefinitely suspended in the past. Who knows what kind of morals are going on at Twitch.

* Ali is no stranger to this behaviour, as another streamer talked about her experiences with this character. During a live stream she said [she was once sexually assaulted at a Twitchcon event without revealing who did it. Sometime later, she revealed that it was Ali himself, and that she was banning people who mentioned his name in order to avoid remembering the incident](https://youtu.be/2jLPFOeA4Rs). Sadly, during another stream, [Ali himself revealed that during another party, he was told to ‚Äúget his dick out‚Äù by another streamer, and this time, he did it next to the aforementioned female streamer so she could see](https://youtu.be/FNITxppXCcw). Quite the gentleman.

* [Ali has filmed a woman breastfeeding in public and quickly pointed the camera TOWARDS HER once he saw what was going on](https://livestreamfails.com/post/18957). You can argue that he was distracted with something else or that he wanted him to be in the middle of the frame, but with a quick glance at the camera AND the woman being one of the few people visible, one really has to wonder what was going on there.

* Despite being obsessed with women, you might find it weird that Ali is fairly misogynistic. [Here‚Äôs a well-known ‚Äúwomen rant‚Äù where does nothing but trash on women for 2 minutes for being rejected at a night club](https://streamable.com/fkbhq). [He also objectifies women by saying he wants to review them on a YouTube series when he goes out partying](https://youtu.be/HNDNAeVE2LE).

* [As the cherry on top, he has also used racial and homophobic slurs on and off his social platforms, including the N-word with a hard R, the N-word in his livestream, and even dropping the f-slur super casually](https://streamable.com/isogmm).

---

Chapter IV: The Aftermath

If you tune in to his livestream or his social media accounts nowadays, you might find that his attitude doesn‚Äôt reflect what has been said here. According to the people who have documented most of this information, this is just an act to avoid being suspended by Twitch, as their Terms of Service got harsher as of the 22nd of January and things such as toxicity, harassment, and even making unsolicited comments about other people (streamers included) can get you in trouble, which he did in most of his previous broadcasts, and he has always been known as a problematic personality. Just a few months ago in October, he went out to parties pretty frequently, challenging UK‚Äôs lockdown rules, where he let some of his personality shine through thanks to the effects of alcohol, as he said ‚Äú[YOU DON‚ÄôT PRETEND TO GO TO A HOSPITAL TO AVOID A DATE, YOU FAT CUNT](https://livestreamfails.com/post/97931)‚Äù once again making derogatory comments towards women who reject him.

He was also under investigation by the UK version of CPS because he would have his daughter on his live broadcasts, but heavily neglecting her. After being reported and ‚Äúaudited‚Äù for months, he later revealed that he is not allowed to have her on camera. This makes sense since someone close to him let people know that he confessed to use his daughter for money and donations, saying things like ‚ÄúTwitch loves kids‚Äù.

---

Chapter V: Answers

As stated before, my aim is not to cancel the guy. I firmly believe that someone can have a problematic past, learn from it, and grow. This, however, doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case for Ali, as some of his recent actions indicate that his past self is still there. I also believe that someone can enjoy a creator‚Äôs content without being bothered by what they have done in the past. Up to a certain limit, of course.

This, however, is a big question for Twitch. If sexual activity with people of barely legal age, grooming, sexual assault, sexual harassment, misogyny and racism is not enough to ban someone who clearly is not fit to represent your platform, what is? Are people like this individually protected by the platform? Just how far is too far?

Does anyone have a way to contact anyone at Twitch, or knows of people who reply when contacted? Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, etc.? I would really love to know why people like these are not only still allowed on the platform, but also protected from any harm."
230,"My name is Valkyrie Weather, born Kyle Cohen, the oldest child and trans daughter of film producer/director Rob Cohen (The fast and the Furious, xXx, and The Hurricane Heist among many others). When I was very young, Rob used my body for his own sexual gratification. My mother witnessed one of the assaults when I was between two and two and a half years old, and has since confirmed what she saw. This fact has cost me more than I could ever convey here. Rob has also raped at least one other woman, in her sleep. I know this because he would occasionally tell the story as an anecdote. ¬†Presumably in an effort to turn me into the straight son that he wanted me to be, Rob took me to see sex workers and establishments in Thailand and The Czech Republic starting when I was as young as 13/14 years old. Through therapy and support from loved ones, I no longer feel that I owe this man any loyalty. And thanks to the #metoo movement, I have found the will to speak out. While Rob will in all likelihood escape criminal justice, I demand that my story be heard. I am not seeking financial restitution, nor do I have a career to promote. My greatest hope is that others who have been hurt by Rob Cohen feel that they are able to come forward as well.

Then my husband said something that crushed me, ‚ÄúI think she‚Äôs lying.‚Äù I said appalled why? Here‚Äôs how this conversation went. 
Him- It happened so long ago 
Me- so did mine, would you not believe me? 
Him-There‚Äôs no evidence. 
Me- There‚Äôs no evidence in mine..would you still believe me? 
Him- She doesn‚Äôt have many witnesses to corroborate her story. 
Me-All I had was my own self as my witness..do you still believe me? 
Him- it‚Äôs just convenient that she steps forward right as he‚Äôs being nominated. 
Me- would you want my rapist to be nominated to Supreme Court? 
He quit speaking after I said that. But nonetheless I am still upset. #whyididntreport and I should have..however now I can really see the trauma I could‚Äôve been under from people not believing me. My rapist was in the military so who knows what could have happened. Ford is amazing for coming forward and speaking up! #metoo"
232,"Over 2 years ago I escaped a horrible living situation where my mom's boyfriend groomed and molested me for 3.5 years. I was encouraged to press charges by friends and did just that. This week after 2 years of the trial pushed back over and over it finally happened. On Tuesday I went on the stand and testified all the horrible things he did to me. And left pretty much after I was done. Come to find out (through my grandma who has supported me despite her daughter, my mom, believing her boyfriend) that my mom and her boyfriend fabricated his existence in our lives and how he lived with us. IE he slept on the couch when he first moved in when in reality he never once did, and tried to claim he was less of a bum than he was. Nonetheless the jury found him guilty of all sexual battery acts on a minor. He could get up to 30 years behind bars. I am so elated that I pushed through this despite all the times I consistered giving up. 

TL;DR : Moms boyfriend was sexually abusive, I pressed charges, and won despite the date being pushed back again and again."
233,"HR blamed me.  The police officer was extremely aggressive and said ""the emotional and verbal abuse was between  me and him"". They don't care he started making comments when I was 16 years old.  What can I do?  The school told the local news I was in the psych hospital so they aren't interested in my story.

UPDATE: a lawyer told me I could write a letter to the school asking them to fire him :D"
234,"Trigger warning: sexual assault

Found this in my old phone's notes when I was looking for music. It reopened some old wounds, and I kind of don't know how to feel now. I figured I'd post it somewhere just to get it off my chest. Be warned, 15 year old me was not great at poetry


Imagine this, you're 15 years young

Life as you know it has barely begun.

You have some great friends, or so you think

When one of them invites you to a house to drink.

It seems harmless enough, it could be fun

As soon as you're through the door, they start feeding you rum.

Your head is spinning, your face feels hot

But at least you have friends near... Or so you thought.

Two leave for a smoke, two leave for other plans

And before you know it, you're left alone with one man.

The two of you talk, just an innocent chat

But then, ""You know for 15, you've got a great rack"".

The room starts to spin, you find it hard to move

Where the hell are your friends who said they'd be back soon?

He half drags you down the hall, this must be a prank

But he unbuttons his pants... And the whole world goes blank.

You wake to a dark room, in a stranger's bed

You remember what happened and feel nothing but dread.

Why did everyone insist he was ""such a cool guy""

When you are 15, and he's 35?"
235,"I would not say that this statement is perhaps controversial because it is indeed factual, but a lot of people believe it is and I want to hear people's thought on both sides. Following rape, there are typically 2 paths women/men go down (not always, but typically): they either avoid sexual encounters for a short or extended period of time or they become hyper-sexual and have sex more frequently with different partners. The reason why this is a controversial statement is because people use hyper-sexuality to say the victim is lying. How could she/he have been raped if she is having sleeping around?? This deep-rooted perception on rape victims has greatly impacted the way we view victims and if the rapist is convicted or not. What are your thoughts about this? Were you aware of hyper-sexuality as a response to rape trauma?"
236,"Here is my story, without details of the assault itself to avoid triggers.

We were friends, he has always been nice to me. On his birthday party he took advantage of my drunken state. 

It took me till a year after the assault to actually go to the police with my case because I felt guilty and already had low self-esteem beforehand, the assault only made things worse and it took some serious therapy to feel enough self respect to stand up for myself and report it.

The whole thing took another 1.5 years till the actual court date, till then the witnesses (one of which saw me naked in his bed the morning after) had some issues remembering and said crucial witness messed up her testimony, had to correct it twice till it made sense but it was still all over the place. My own testimony was pretty consistent in itself and basically identical to what I told the police 1.5 years ago.

At the end he was acquited on all accounts because of the inconsistencies of the other witnesses even though the prosecutor basically stated how she believes me after seeing me cry so terribly at my testimony and the judge decided that there was not enough clear evidence to convict him.

I tried to prepare myself for that case but was devastated still. That was about a month ago.

And some days ago I found an article anonymously retelling the whole deal with the details of my assault and they literally titled it ""Imagination or Seeking for Attention?"" and the whole thing is written so damn biased against me, portaying me as this crazy woman with schizophrenic episodes and I just didnt expect this amount of gatekeeping. Meanwhile he is portayed as a fucking saint and they even quote me saying I was shocked he was capable of something so vile because he always has been kind and somehow they turn that against me. 

Also I had minor auditory hallucinations in my medical record that appeared after the trauma because, who could have thought, I'm traumatized and the rapists attorney and the news weaponize that against me.

Honestly I have lost faith in my country's legal system (Germany). I respect that they don't want innocent people to get falsely sentenced and I can imagine it would have been horrible for anyone to go through that but I'm not surprised anymore that some people think twice before actually reporting crimes. It has been a mostly horrible experience to me with constant retraumatizing and gatekeeping, losing friends (not very good ones) and I feel like I made myself relive the thing more than is healthy.

But I want to tell myself it was a good decision. I probably would have questioned my decision forever if I decided against it and would have blamed myself if he ever did something to someone else.

He will probably be marked for the rest of his life, his whole town thinks he is a rapist and he lost a lot of friends. He will probably have even more trouble getting with a girl now and he probably won't be trying something with someone else again in fear he doesnt get off the hook next time. Even the people who stayed with him and defend him will have a seed of doubt in them and if someone accuses him of something next time he will have a much harder time. I just want at least others to be safe from him. 

Now I went and appealed the court decision. So instead of the lower regional court a higher court will go over the case again and they might come to another verdict.
Honestly, even my attorney told me my chances are slim but I could not forgive myself for not going the whole mile. It will probably be the whole thing over again, retraumatizing me, especially when I have to retell the assault in detail with my rapist in the same room.


 I secretly hope he somehow starts feeling sorry and just admits everything, it would be the ideal outcome I think. I want this nightmare to stop, I stopped living 3 years ago, I'm just a shell, a train wreck trying to get my life together but I get triggered again and again and cant even do basic everyday chores without crying. I hope he realizes how badly this whole thing affected me and feels at least a bit of remorse.

I am not asking for anything from anyone on here. I just wanted to vent and after typing this out sobbingly I feel a little better."
237,"I was with a man for a few months, I could even have called him a boyfriend at the time although we never made things official. For a few weeks to a month when we first met and were active having sex we used condoms. We would be safe as far as I knew and checked since I was not on birth control. 

It wasn‚Äôt until one night when him and I were being intimate that I had noticed him stop for a quick second while I laid on my back asking what was wrong and he replied ‚Äúnothing trying to get harder is all‚Äù.... I naively believed him. We got back to it and when he finished I noticed his condom was off, throw to the side of the bed. I realized he had finished inside of me and took his confirm off halfway through while knowing how serious I was about making sure it was on and secure at all time. I remember being in disbelief and not knowing what to say... ‚Äúdid you... did you take the condom off???‚Äù Realizing he had finished inside me at this point I began to freak out even harder. He subtly said ‚Äúyeah but it‚Äôs okay I just really wanted to feel you‚Äù. 

I was naive. I was a victim. I had consensual sex with a man who at a point turned against my consent and did something harmful, and detrimental and most important non consensual to my body. The second he did this, the second our understanding of using that condom became null is what I consider non consensual... some may say rape. Perhaps I‚Äôm still in denial 2 years later to even think of the idea that someone I was with would have raped me. I didn‚Äôt experience the fear of rape with a stranger and endangerment because no one told me someone you were dating and trusted could rape you. To me rape was always this idea of someone random, a victim, a target by chance... but looking back I understand. I was raped. I was raped in a scenario where I was not even aware it was happening until it was over with. I can‚Äôt begin to imagine the what if‚Äôs of if this had happened before and if i was too naive to look or check or know. 

I trusted you. But you broke my trust and acted like it was nothing. You put my body at risk, you put me in a position where I felt betrayed, used, and terrified of the possibility I would end up pregnant when I thought I was so safe. You‚Äôre reasoning? ‚ÄúIf you end up pregnant I‚Äôll help you take care of it‚Äù... but I didn‚Äôt want a baby. I didn‚Äôt want to be pregnant. I didn‚Äôt consent to you even doing what you did. And yet I still remained with you for a few months after that. Because I didn‚Äôt know at the time that this wasn‚Äôt normal, I thought I was over reacting, that maybe from my abusive past relationships this is what all relationships end up like. But it‚Äôs not and it should never be what you experience most importantly with someone you trust to be intimate with and trust with your consent to your own parameters and limits.

I was raped. It took me 2 years and a long term loving NEW boyfriend who does nothing but treat me in every way possible as a delicate rose. Who asks for my consent and doesn‚Äôt get mad when I‚Äôm not in the mood. Who cherishes my body and assures me he would never do and has never done something against my own will. It took me 2 YEARS and finding my soulmate to finally realize what a health and non abusive relationship was. To finally acknowledge that I was raped. #metoo"
238,"Sometimes we need to be reminded that it wasn‚Äôt our fault, so take it from me that it wasn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt need to know the situation, it could have been your boyfriend, they could have been paying you, it literally doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs not your fault. You didn‚Äôt deserve it."
239,"Ok so idk if this belongs here or not but..
I had nightmares my entire life about a certain family member forcing himself upon me and my sister and being too little to do anything about it.
I always thought it was just bad dreams until a therapist told me I was sexually abused as a child.
The only person I told, up until recently was my (extremely religious) grandfather, who told me to pity him and be glad that he ""got better"", so I did what most males do and buried my feelings.. 
I was grown now, so its not like he can get me again..

So flash forward to recently..
That certain family member(43?) comes to my grandpas house with this new awesome mower.. I live with my grandpa and we have 6 acres, most of which is farmland. Garden, orchard, poultry, the whole deal; so I was super excited about the mower, that I could cut paths through the woods and trails through the overgrown grass in the paddocks.
Until I went out to my campsite I have on the corner of my (grandpa's) property, and found a bunch of my tools missing, and random belongings of my son's (4) thrown all over the place.
They were inside of a junk car I had parked out there that our certain someone, along with his younger brother took in for scrap.
His younger brothers girlfriend is the owner of the car, and she told me I could store stuff in it since the transmission was broke. Its been sitting in my yard since last summer.

Okay.. So that's all the context..
Flash forward to today..
I put up a no trespassing sign outside my camp, and barricaded the large path leading into it, so no vehicles could make it there.
That certain someone calls me on the phone and asks why I have barricades and a no trespassing sign, I told him how I found my son's belongings thrown in the mud and my tools were missing and I think it was him so to just fuck off and ill mow my own yard, and hung up.
(The mower is actually my grandpa's as hes the one that bought it, but our barn and garage is so full that we store it over at that certain someone's garage. He lives nearby.)
He got super mad about it and ripped the no trespassing sign out if the ground, and came to my moms house, who lives next door to my grandpa, where I was fixing my moms fence and wanted to fight me over it..
Ive been scared of this guy my whole life, but something in me just snapped today..
I heard him yelling my name and holding the metal sign like an axe, so I grabbed the knife I was cutting ropes with earlier, pocketed it, and walked over to him.
He kept going on about how its not my property, its my grandpa's so I cant put up a no trespassing sign at my campsite because its everyone's campsite..
(I spent the last 4 summers out there with my son turning a fire pit in the woods into a nice little hangout with campers and fences and a gazebo.. Just my son and me)
We argued back and forth for a little while on the legitimacy of the sign, and why I put it there in the first place but then he held the sign like a baseball bat and I thought he was going to swing it at me.
(Its a thin sheet-metal sign)
He has bullied me my whole life.. and something in me changed and I wasnt scared anymore.
I pulled my knife out and told him to gtfo my moms yard. His son (18) and ""other"" younger brother (24?) Who were spectators up til this point then ran up and got between us.. I thought they were going to take him away, but they both started yelling at me instead.. No one was listening to why I was mad at him or why I put the sign up, so I got scared they were going to jump me and I stabbed the sign.
It made a loud noise that sent everyone back a step.
I told them all to leave and not to come back if they're not going to respect me or my stuff.
He said something real simple like ""fuck you bitch, I'll kick your ass!"" And then for the first time out loud I yelled ""Oh yeah? you raped me and my sister when I was only 4 years old, I should cut you just for that!""
His son and brother followed me back to my moms house as I walked backward with the knife until I reached the porch. (Where my 4yo son was) yelling at me the whole time, while I swiped at them with my knife, but his entire mannerisms and attitude changed..
He went from wanting to hit me with a sign, to pulling his son and brother away.
Funny thing is.. HE called the cops on ME.
said that hes going to put me in jail for pulling a knife out and swiping it at them..
I didnt tell the cops about the sexual abuse though, just that we argued about the sign and that I pulled a knife because I felt threatened and I didnt want to press charges..and they just agreed with me and told me to have a good day.

I was 4 when it happened and I'm 32 now.
He knows I know now.
It was a whole thing in front of his family.
His wife knows. Sons. Daughters. Brothers.
For some reason I was too ashamed to tell the cops.
Also.. I'm the type of person that does not like to appeal to the law unless someone dies.. I'm super apprehensive when it comes to police to begin with.

I just.. For some reason, feel so much shame that I was abused that its hard to explain, and guilty/sad when I think about actually putting him behind bars.
I know I did good by actually confronting him about it today, but I'm scared about whats going to happen next. I dont want to be scared, but I got a feeling im going to sleep with my pistol for a while.

Someone please tell me I did the right thing."
240,"Did donald trump rape this 13 year young girl: **[#JusticeForKatie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbFJWo3gdRI)** ?

>In 1994, donald trump allegedly attended multiple underage sex ""parties"" consisting of elderly men engaging in sexual acts with minors. This young girl, only 13 at the time, and a virgin, recounts what she claims are at least 3 occasions when she was raped by him, including being tied to a bed and brutally having her virginity stolen. She also claims that after the event, while on her knees crying, he tells her that she should ""be happy that someone like donald trump raped her"".

241,Nobody talks about child-on-child sexual assault is a thing bc it‚Äôs ‚Äúuncomfortable‚Äù but I am a victim. We need to bring more awareness to this. I kept quiet for so many years out of fear. But I won‚Äôt be silenced anymore. #metoo
242,"I didn‚Äôt really wanna type out everything I went thru then so I figured the link would work just as well but Reddit kept saying it‚Äôs not valid so I‚Äôll put the link in the comments. Please read that first..

That was a little over two years ago and on February 3rd his trial begins. A few months after my assault, my best friend and main supporter, my mom passed away. I fell into a deep depression afterwards and isolated myself so no one could see me this way. Since then I haven‚Äôt really told anyone about this and as the trial date looms I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll have to go to court all alone. I can‚Äôt think of anyone I could trust enough to bring with me.. I‚Äôve had my interview done by the prosecution but I‚Äôm terrified of the cross examination because it always seems so brutal on tv and movies. And I‚Äôve been trying to write my victim impact statement for a couple months now and I feel as though I can‚Äôt get my words to sound meaningful or important enough... I want him to remember that I put him away and he‚Äôs going to die in prison for what he did to me, and he won‚Äôt ever be able to harm another young girl again. 

I was wondering if anyone might share about their personal experiences in taking their abuser/rapist to court/how cross examination really is and maybe even share their VIS? Also if anyone lives near Skagit county, Washington state and would maybe be willing to show up for me,  please dm me for more info."
243,"I'm not sure this is the exact right place to post this, but I figured it is a start. For years now, I have seen person after person write about the monstrous things that Jared Leto has done. Typically, they come up anytime he is mentioned in a thread here, but he never seems to get the attention placed on him directly. I find it frustrating that so many people have shared their stories about him, but they are always buried in a thread about something completely unrelated. I'd like to try and start a compilation of all of the experiences that people have had with him, with the hope that someday soon, it can be used to help bring him to justice. Does anyone here have a story about Jared Leto that they would be willing to share?"
244,"So I've been going to therapy for a while after being admitted to a mental hospital, when I was in the hospital I talked about the fact that I was raped for the first time. I was later diagnosed with ptsd. I'm currently 17, when I was raped by my brother I was 7 and he was 12. My parents have known for a while and don't care. I'm expected to be nice to him and treat him as though it never happened. So recently I was talking to them about when the right day of the week to celebrate my birthday and my mother wanted to celebrate it early so that my brother could make it, i told her that i'd rather not have him there and scolded, telling me that I have to make sacrifices on special occassions.

WHAT THE FUCK, its my birthday not his!!!!! And I have to make sacrifices??????

I explained to them the night terrors and trauma. I literally broke down described them in detail and in turn my parents held a bored expression as if my brother had simply spilled a glass of milk and made a mistake. I was crying my fucking eyes out while trying to talk about it and when I looked at them I could not see any hint of empathy whatsoever.

so fuck my life yay it's gonna be a shitfest"
245,"My father was left alone at six years old with a group of teenage boys by his older brother. While he was with them alone, they sexually violated him. He never received help to recover from this traumatic event and it lead to self-medicating with alcohol by the age of 12. He carried this with him through his whole life and the alcoholism and losing my older brother at birth ruined his marriage to my mother. They divorced. 

It was the agreement that I would spend every other weekend with him. Most of the time he was constantly drunk and did quite a number of things to me. I won‚Äôt go into detail but it was childhood sexual abuse. It started when I was 5 as I can remember and went on until I stopped going to see him at 18 years old. I developed dissociative identity disorder very early into this abuse so I didn‚Äôt remember any of it until I was 22. 

I lived my whole life as the kid who forgets things sometimes, the kid who had voices in her head that she called imaginary friends, the kid who ‚Äúlied‚Äù and did strange things, or who went off for no reason because of the symptoms of my disorder. 

When I finally started to remember it came back in nightmares. I was going through a really abusive relationship and it triggered it all. The memories come and go now. Sometimes they‚Äôre crystal clear and sometimes it‚Äôs just a blurr of horrible emotions and sometimes it seems like they‚Äôre not there at all... but... 

When someone goes through something traumatic at a young age and show signs of it, it‚Äôs our job as fellow human beings. And especially if your a parent and these kids show signs of it, to get them the help they need right away. 

My father was a completely different person when he was sober. He was caring and gentle even though he still showed signs of trauma. When he was drunk it was totally different. The symptoms of the trauma became so much worse and his daughter (me) was the only thing around to dull the pain. He passed a little over two years ago and never received help to heal from his trauma. It twisted him up and turned him into a monster. 

I however truly believe that had his family got him the help he needed at a young age he would have never been twisted up into the ‚Äúman‚Äù he became. It‚Äôs so important to tell our stories even if we don‚Äôt or can‚Äôt get justice. It‚Äôs so important to spread the awareness and advocate for the mental health aspect of abuse.

My family couldn‚Äôt help me, I showed no real signs of being abused. But my father did. Stories his side of the family tells of him as a child shows clear signs of it. They didn‚Äôt know that those are clear signs, but I‚Äôm not fully convinced that if they did know they would have done anything. I have strong reasons to believe that they are horrible awful people because of the way they have treated me. 

But there are very good parents out there who do watch and care about their children. I hope your children are always safe from harm. But it‚Äôs always good to know the signs. The RAINN.org website is a perfect resource to learn all you need to know. 

Stay safe my friends and stay strong. Always speak out, we can‚Äôt let others silence us. "

SOOO. now in Alabama if your rape claim cannot be proven in court you will go to prison for ten years and pay the defendants legal fees. now we all know false claims are awful and damaging, BUT RAPE IS HARD TO PROVE.

crime in general is hard to prove. serial killers aren‚Äôt convicted of all of their crimes. i know a man who raped four children but only two families could prove it. should the other kids or parents be put in prison??? hell no. we need to protest this.

249,"I'll try to keep this brief, but everything is so fresh that I apologize if I ramble.
Three nights ago my boyfriend, his best friend and I went out for drinks. The friend was visiting from out of state so this was the first time I had met him. My boyfriend and I have been dating five months.
We hit up a few bars, had a few cocktails and everything seemed to be going well. His friend was acting a little overly friendly towards me but I chalked it up to being buzzed. 
The last thing I remember was getting up to use the restroom and coming back to the table to finish my drink.
After that I completely blacked out. I don't remember leaving the bar. I don't remember how we got back to my boyfriend's house. I literally have no memory of anything whatsoever after I finished my last drink.
The next thing I remember is waking up, nude, laying on my BF's couch with his friend on top of me, groping my breasts. My BF was standing at the opposite end of the room screaming at me to get house of my house- I immediately pushed his friend off of me and started yelling what's happening? What did you do to me? What's going on? I was in complete shock and still felt like I was dreaming. My BF flew into a rage like I've never seen before. His eyes literally went black and I was terrified that he was going to hurt me. I've never been so afraid in my entire life! I was assaulted while I was passed out, he obviously walked in on the assault happening and blamed me for everything. Again, I have ZERO memory of anything after the last bar and I absolutely DID NOT give any consent. 
I've filed a police report and been tested at the hospital. No contact whatsoever with the boyfriend (obviously now ex-BF). The police will make contact with him today to find out who this friend is and how to find him. 
I'm beyond shocked, hurt and angry. I don't know how I'll ever recover from this, tbh.
Thank you for listening. I feel like my life is ruined üò¢"
250,Men are laughed at when woman sexually assualt them. They are to scared to speak up.
251,"When I was today years old I was told by a dear friend of mine that she had been cornered and shamed for wearing clothes that made her feel beautiful by men 3 times her age

When I was 25 I discovered I was being stalked by an ex, and so I put a weapon in every room of my home.

When I was 24 I was cornered in a parking lot while I was alone. I started walking with  my hand in my purse, ready to pull out my gun

When I was 23 I was grabbed by the arm and was almost pulled into a bush. I purchased my first gun the next week.

When I was 21 I was catcalled first the first time. I felt so dirty and ashamed.

When I was 20 something unspeakable began happening to me for 3 years by someone I trusted. I blamed myself and believed the lies I had been told.

When I was 18 I was sent my first dick pic. It was the first of hundreds.

When I was 18 my father gave me a taser for Christmas. I bought my first can of mace. It was pink. Designed specifically for women.

When I was 17 I was screamed at that I looked like a whore and a prostitute by someone I trusted. I stopped wearing clothes that made me feel sexy.

When I was 15 the boy behind me thought it would be fun to snap my bra strap over and over till my skin was sore. I wore sports bras after that.

When I was 6 something unspeakable happened to me from someone I trusted,so I made an imaginary friend and pretended it had happened to her.

When I was 5 my grandfather told me that I should keep an aspirin between my knees so no one would look up my skirt. This was the first time I ever felt ashamed of my body.

Every woman you have met, grown up with, or loved, has had something like this happen to her. Allowing sexist comments, or jokes about sexual assault, or any kind of ‚Äúlocker room talk‚Äù continue, you are giving people permission to go even farther. Fight against something that has been rooted in all of us for all of history. Stop giving people permission.

252,"After looking for a therapist I finally found one I liked. An older somewhat attractive man maybe in his early 50s. He seemed kind and genuinely wanting to help me cope with my mental illnesses and trauma without having to take a cocktail of drugs. For 2 months I met this guy once a week, after being in therapy since I was a child I know they need to know things, thats how it works. So when he told me he specializes in sexual trauma and abuse I felt comforted and relief knowing maybe this guy can really help me. Each time I came in we talked about things that happened, things I repressed, and things I didn't really want to talk about. But thats therapy. At least I thought so. I didn't see him for 3 almost 4 weeks because I had covid and when I got better I was in desperate need to see him. I hadn't been sleeping, my insomnia was at its worst its ever been and I have been doing things im not proud of. I'm pretty self aware for being so crazy so I knew I was either having an episode or just needed some sleep. So the day came. I walked in as usual. Talked a bit about covid and how I was feeling. I right away told him ""I haven't slept in 2 weeks, my insomnia is really bad"" to which he asked a series of questions related to why I might not be sleeping. He segwayed so quickly into asking if I watch porn and if that keeps me up. Im honest and he knows my trauma so I said well when I can't sleep ill browse and browse. He asked ""what kind? Is it normal or rough? Men or women?"" At this point i thought. Maybe he's thinking im up watching torture porn and can't sleep because I've been abused. Like hes giving me a psychoanalysis. So when I give him my answer, the room shifted. Like someone sucked all the oxygen out of it. His demeanor changed and he became even more inappropriate. He knows I have compulsive habits like masturbating, pulling my hair and scratching my face so when he asked me if I've been harming myself I said ""not me"" which lead him to ask me to see my breasts and the bruising I have on them from rough sex I've been having in what I can only assume during manic episodes. But im not the doctor, and apparently this guy isn't either. I was stunned he asked me to take my shirt off. This is my 5th male therapist Ive had in my life. Not one of them has ever made me feel the way that man did. When I told him ""no and I think you're being inappropriate"" his response was ""you don't want to take medication because it messes with your creativity, you have to talk about things then, even if it makes you feel uncomfortable"" Once again, shocked he said that to me especially because the first thing I said was ""I hadn't slept in 2 weeks"" obviously I was going to ask for medication. And im sure he would've given it to me. I'm easy prey. Come back even more out if it and then what? Really take advantage of me? I started to cry grabbed my purse, didn't pay for the session and told him he shouldn't be a doctor and something is wrong with him. I know the receptionist heard me as I stormed out. I was so shaken I could hardly walk to my car and put my keys in the ignition. What just happened? Am I imagining this? Am I so sleep deprived I've somehow made this up? For 30 minutes I sat on the side of the road crying. Who do I even tell this to? I can hardly wrap my head around what happened let alone tell someone else. I eventually gathered myself and called my boyfriend of 10 years and bestfriend of 16 years. Sobbing trying to explain what this man did. He seemed just as confused. He has watched me meltdown and lose control before and I couldn't fathom explaining the entire thing but I needed to know I wasn't in the wrong and im not crazy for thinking he was inappropriate. So I called my mom. Who might not handle certain things well all the time but when it came to my sexual abuse and mental illnesses she is my rock. Shes saved my life more times than I can count just by giving me reassurance and support. She agreed. He was inappropriate and I need to file a complaint. Which was never something I wasn't going to do. My first thought other than this man's audacity was ""if he's doing this to me at 29, what the hell is he saying and doing to young more vulnerable boys and girls"" the thought still makes me sick to my stomach. I can still feel his eyes on me looking at me like he could take what he wanted if he wanted to. I had no self worth, his for the taking. It's like its burned in my brain. From across the room I could feel his erection over my trauma and uncomfortability with me talking about it. This is what he does. This sick man made a career out of preying on weak people who are desperate for help. At first I was shaken, and to be quite honest in need of more help now than ever but first I need to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone again. The next day I got a call on a private number and the lady said ""this isn't the first time something like this has happened"" and to make as many complaints till someone listens. Maybe I am naive but I truly didn't think there were people out there who could do that to someone whose barley hanging on. I needed to vent. A lot of people can't relate I am curious if anybody else has experienced this from a medical professional?"
253,"An open letter to my rapist,
      I don‚Äôt know your name. All I remember is that you were a lawyer, which is ironic. I vaguely remember meeting you at a bar in Belltown in Seattle. Your friends joined my friends at our table as we drank. As the night went on, I don‚Äôt remember much, just bits and pieces. I remember that I passed out in the bathroom of the bar. I remember you coming in to get me. Everyone else left. My friends ditched me. You took it upon yourself to take me back to your apartment and you took advantage of me at my weakest and most vulnerable. I remember waking up the next morning. I remember you touching me. I still didn‚Äôt remember your name. You forced yourself upon me. Not knowing what you were capable of and having nobody know where I was, I didn‚Äôt actually say no. I was terrified. I wholeheartedly believe I said no with my body language, but I felt no other choice but to go along with it for my safety. Not only did I have to realize you raped me that night, but you used your power to have your way with me the morning after while I was sober. I will never forget that feeling of powerlessness over my body. It took so much of me to not burst into tears, but again, I was so scared. I knew nothing about you except the fact that you preyed on me the night before. I stood in your apartment overlooking Lake Union as you got ready for work and then sent me on my way out of your home. I had no money. No phone. I had to figure out where I was and find my way home doing the walk of shame and replaying the little memories of the night that I had.
	I want you to know that what you did still haunts me. The fact that you were a predator and took advantage of a young 21 year old woman after you found her passed out on a bathroom floor speaks volumes as to who you are as a person. I wish I remembered your name. I wish I could remember your face, but after 9 years, I have worked hard to block out these memories until this #metoo movement started. 
	You see, as painful as it is to revisit these difficult memories, it is completely necessary so that women gain more strength and power by using their voice. I said nothing back then because I knew nobody would believe me. I didn‚Äôt think anyone would believe a 21 year old girl who went out drinking was raped by a lawyer. Hell, look at all the women who came forward about Larry Nassar. It took SO many women - SO SO many women before anyone gave them the time of day. This needs to change. Our voices need to be heard. 
	So to my rapist, you no longer have power over me. I am done blaming myself. I am done using the excuse that it was my fault because I drank too much. No. This is not okay. It is not okay to prey on women when they are weak. You help them get a cab (or uber now, I guess), and send them home. You don‚Äôt fucking rape them. 
     This is my voice. I am finally sharing my story. I know you‚Äôll probably never actually read this letter, but I hope that this gives other women the courage to come forward if something like this has happened to them. Seek justice. I sure wish I had. "
254,"Hello, everyone. Please be nice with me as I am extremely new to reddit. I've read stories for the past year and I've decided it's my time to open up. I'm a 35M that has a very interesting story to share. Please pretty please excuse my horrendous grammer. I'm not too bright and you shall see why. And I do apologize for this very long post. But I absolutely have to get this out. I cannot hold it back anymore. 
 I guess my story will start when I was still in diapers. One of my most early memories, I remember I was being trained for the potty and because I was being such a little bugger to my father about it. I had gone into my diaper. That had extremely irritated my father to the point I remember him yanking on my arm and throwing me into a small little white wooden dresser from the 70s. I honestly don't remember much after that day. A few years go by, I would say 1 1/2 years, I was about 4 at the time. I was following my father up the stairs and that was annoying him. He turned around said here take this effing cat and threw it down the stairs at me landing on my head giving me a life long scar across my upper lip. In the Summer of 1990. We lived in this huge house. We all called the ""Farm house""  it was an old colonial farm home in Upstate New York. I always liked that house but I never understood why. It was where my sexual abuse started, two of the worst nightmares I still visually see awake was in that house. 
  It was My Mother, father, brother half brother and half sister. My half brother and sister were already 10 year older then me. My ""full"" brother was 6 years older. Dad was a drunk and a pot head, Mother was pretty much the same. It all started when I used to beg my brothers to join in on the old lone wolf adventure books, and beg to play the nes Mike Tysons knockout. I remember everyone at the house was doing stuff outside and down stairs. My full brother, ( we shall call him Demon lol) that's when Demon decided to convince me to let him stick a belt buckle into my rectum. If I did that I would be shown how to play the lone wolf book and get to play Mike Tysons knockout on the nes. So being a very simple minded boy I agreed. That moment that buckle was used. I screamed and ran down stairs, remembering him yelling to me ""dont tell mom dont tell mom"" after I told my mother I got the response, "" go tell your father"" so im crying in pain holding my butt. Wondering around outside asking all the strangers if they had seen my father. Not being able to find him, but to stepping right on a nail going through my entire foot. And behold my father appears from thin air. Saying its my fault I stepped on a nail. He carried me into the house. I'm crying my eyes out because not only did my butt hurt  still my foot now had a nail completely through it. He then ripped it right out after he and my mother yelled at me for being outside when the house was being worked on. Not much happened after that. 
We then moved when I was 7 years old down the street. Thats when it started to get crazy. He would force me to perform oral sex on him. He would put pornographies on and tell me Im that woman on the screen. He would then start to steal our half sisters underwear and would make me model them for him. He always used the words ""if you don't do this I will kill you and dad will strangle me and drown you"" or "" ill slice your throat in your sleep if you tell anyone"" this went on almost every night until I was 9 thats when he first raped me. It was Christmas. And I got nothing from Santa I asked for ( parents too busy getting drunk and High) but it was better then nothing and I was fine with that. I remember playing with my blankets. ( I used to form them into the shape of a car and pretend crash it then pretend rescue the victims ) I fell asleep doing that. And I woke up to this intense heat in my rear end then this  odd feeling and then I noticed what was going on. I tried to escape Demon pinned me down. I remember biting his hand making him bleed. And him punching me in the back of the head and lights out. This went on about monthly then weekly for 2 more years. Meanwhile I was always told I would never amount to anything. I'm a loser, I'm a weakling. Exc. By my father. Mother never did anything but walk away when my father would talk like that. 
 At the age of 11, Demon had also forced oral sex upon our younger female cousin. She wasn't scared. She came forth and told that next day. Demob had ran away from home. He was found hiding in the woods. by our cousins mother. I remember my parents sitting me down. Trying to figure out how to explain what was going on. Them stumbling trying to figure out how to explain molestation. After they finished I remember blurring out crying "" me too, me too he did stuff to me too"" I remember my father getting extremely pissed my mother just walked away from me. And nothing was ever said about it. Two weeks had gone by as Demon was sitting in jail turning his sweet 16 in Adult Jail. They made me talk to him on the phone. Then the next day they bailed him out of jail. Mind you we shared bedrooms and still were. He gets out and my parents wouldn't allow him to shut the door at night. But he would wait till they all fell asleep and would start his routine again. And the cycle was going again. I remember praying to God asking for help. To my brother calling me a new found B@$% boy we then moved again. And it ended between me and Demon. Nothibg more ever happened between us. I was glad. But I wasn't glad he was still walking around a free person and I was suffering in silence forced in silence. As I grew up I would tell school counselors principles. But no one took me serious because I turned to become so defiant to my parents. And my parents would always tell them. He's using his trauma as a crutch. I would always get mad as heck and yell "" no I just want some justice"" my father would repeatedly tell me ""everyone deals with it just get over it already."" Even one night he offered to kill my brother in a drunken state. I indulged. But nothing ever happened. *Thank YOU* at this point I was 15 and just put on pins. (Persons I need supervised) the school recommended my parents to have me put on is because I was completely out of control. 
I was spiraling and I could breathe, was lost. Still am lost I just wanted to share my story. Maybe one day I will get Justice and Peace. But until then I shall struggle inside my mind. 

  Thank you for reading. And I do apologize for my extremely terrible grammer. ü•∫üò∞üò≠"
255,"I was looking for meaningful discussion on reddit and only seeing people saying good things, like that he was sensitive and said all the right things.  And there was no mention of it here in r/metoo.  I just don‚Äôt understand.  
Sure, it could have been worse, but I didn‚Äôt see anything praiseworthy.  On the contrary, in the special, there was no apology, and no acknowledgement of the alleged victim‚Äôs experience of that night.  He didn‚Äôt even make a statement that women shouldn‚Äôt have to be in situations like the one his alleged victim described.  (He wouldn‚Äôt even have to say that‚Äôs what actually happened in order to make such a statement!) He totally whiffed on that one. 
Even worse, he then brushes off the whole subject (‚Äúwow, that was intense.‚Äù) and segues into an extended set on racism and the hypocrisy of ‚Äúwoke‚Äù white people (seemingly the form of discrimination that ‚Äúreally‚Äù matters to him). He says, ‚ÄúThings don‚Äôt start being racist just because white people suddenly see it.‚Äù  Uh, right.  And things don‚Äôt start being misogynistic just because men see them, either.  And then he engages in fat shaming (i.e., denigrating one of the few groups of people that it is still ok to dehumanize).  It‚Äôs all so tone deaf that it seems it must be intentional.  Did he not have at least one woman on the team with the guts and sense to say, ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt going to come off well.‚Äù? 
And as if that weren‚Äôt enough, he later tries to say that we can‚Äôt judge people/actions that took place in ‚Äúa different time‚Äù.  It‚Äôs true that we see the world differently than we did just a few years ago.  We still judge Nazis, slaves owners, etc., though, so why would men be different in the metoo era?  And whatever he was trying to achieve with his opening non-apology, he think that, in the very same special, he can tell people they aren‚Äôt allowed to judge him?  Nope.  No thank you. That is way too self-serving; you don‚Äôt get to make that decision for me.  (No, I don‚Äôt think he was explicitly talking about himself at the time. However, see above re: tone deaf.)  And re: the P&R Rashida Jones/teddy bear scene, instead of, ‚ÄúI think Tom would go to jail for that.‚Äù, how about, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs creepy and gross!‚Äù?!?
The whole thing angers me, in part because I have always thought he was hilarious and a good guy.  I loved Master of None, was devastated to hear that he was accused.  I was determined to give him the benefit of the doubt...until I saw this. 
I‚Äôm disgusted and so, so, so disappointed.  I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm more upset about him or that others are praising it instead of calling out his poor judgement/taste (if nothing else) in the special‚Äôs content.  I can‚Äôt imagine this will stand up well over time. 

To be clear: 
1) I haven‚Äôt read the full account of his alleged victim, but what I did read doesn‚Äôt sound like ‚Äúassault‚Äù to me. That doesn‚Äôt make it right, though. Would anyone want a guy to treat their mother, sister, cousin, niece, daughter or granddaughter the way she describes?  That would be difficult to imagine. 
2) I don‚Äôt think she changed her story to get back at him; women are put through the wringer when they make accusations.  (The accused men are, too.  No doubt.)  Aside from an unhinged person, I can‚Äôt imagine a woman would choose to go through all that comes with making an accusation without a strong sense of duty to try to protect other women from the same experience. My gut says that she was uncomfortable with the situation at the time, but went along with things rather than stand up for herself in the face of what allegedly felt like intense pressure from him. Then, after the fact, she realized just how awful it was that he (allegedly) ignored her efforts to show that she wanted to stop, and instead kept pressuring her. Maybe in a few more years, I will consider that assault. Today, I don‚Äôt.  But I certainly wouldn‚Äôt set a friend up with someone I expected to behave that way, either. 
3) It seems obvious to me that there is a lot of nasty racism happening, as there has been for (at least) hundreds of years.  I‚Äôm not trying to discount or dismiss any of that.  My only issues were i) that he seemed to be intentionally using racism to distract from his alleged role in another persistent form of inequality, and ii) that he seems to think fat shaming is still ok.  I think it is offensive and disrespectful (to everyone concerned) to discuss racism in that context for that purpose. Otherwise, bring it on.  Let‚Äôs talk about how stupid and pervasive racism is, and how hypocritical white people can be even/especially as they start to ‚Äúget it‚Äù.  We all need that dose of reality, and humor is a great way to get people to face uncomfortable truths. Just don‚Äôt do it as a way to throw ladies under the bus or distract from allegations about you.  We are better than that, and so are you, Aziz.  At least I thought you were. 
4) I didn‚Äôt watch the whole thing. I got so disgusted by the above, I shut it off.  I know he says more at the end, but I can‚Äôt imagine it would improve how I see the rest of it."
256,"This was ten years ago, as now I'm 23 & it happened when I was 13. You never expect your uncle, or any family members to be able to do such disgusting things. Things that could tear a family apart, if let out in the light. I was 13, and spending the night with my Aunt (my moms sister). So her husband (who is a drunk) isn't my blood uncle. Decided he was gonna; come in the room where I was sleeping and molest me. I was in the bed, with his 2 girls. It was 2:38, because I looked at the alarm clock as I opened my eyes. As I wake up I see him, crouched down like a animal. He's beside the bed, with his fingers in me. Not touching me but inside me. I was shocked. I didn't know how to respond, so I got up & got in the bed with my Aunt. He comes in the bedroom, where my Aunt is, lays in the bed, and the nasty man tries to touch me. While I'm in the bed with HIS WIFE/MY AUNT. I just laid there and cried. The next morning I get up, and walk home. When I got there I went straight to my bathroom, got in the shower, turned the water on,  and just cried. I was 13, I was still a baby. Why? I never told no one, til I was married."
257,"I just need to get this off my chest, I have seen a therapist when I was a late teen for a few months and have really healed. It is just one of those nights where I can't stop thinking about it.

I was involved with a really bad crown when I was 14-15, they were older uni students who just liked to party and liked to see me drunk. Right after I turned 15 I snuck out to go to a party. I really didn't want to go but I was so easily convinced back then. I met this older guy, it's hard to remember what we talked about but we had a lot in common. I specifically remember that he wanted to buy more alcohol but he couldn't find his wallet. He asked me if I would go back to his place to look for it. I reluctantly said yes..... Fuck I was so stupid....... We went back to his place, a small basement suite. He told me to go look in the living room while he disappeared down the tiny hall in his room. He comes out and just pulls me in to kiss me. I told him no and tried to get away. He grabbed my arm and pushed me against a wall and tried again. I yelled at him to fuck off and push him off. I tried to get away but he grabbed me again and pulled out a knife and put it to my neck. He told me to shut the fuck up or he would kill me. I kiss him back out of fear, I didn't care what would happen I just didn't want to die. I started crying and told him to please stop. He pressed the knife harder into my neck. He then pushed me to his bedroom, I tried to get up and run but he held down my arms and was sitting on top of me (at this point I didn't know where he put the knife). He got right in my face and told me to stop resisting him, I just kept crying while he pulled down my underwear (the night i decide to wear a dress....) and he pulled down his pants just enough for him to get his dick out and rape me. I told him to stop over and over and that it hurt, he didn't care. I'll never forget this pain, it felt as though everything was tearing and bleeding, it hurt so much and there was so much blood. I was a virgin before this.... after he came he started choking me, I thought I was gonna die. He pushed harder and told me that if I told anyone about this that he would fucking kill me. He let me go right before I passed out. I remember barely being able to walk but I managed to get the hell out of there and walk home. I was in shock, after that I was never the same. There are some days where I wish I was killed..... I still have nightmares and get anxious in social settings, I'm 22 now btw. I have only told 4 people in my life, I could never tell my family and I could never tell my friends, the last thing I want are for people to talk about it or get uncomfortable around me. I never told the police because I didn't think I could handle it. I still feel guilty about letting him off, idk how many more women he had raped after me and if only I had reported him maybe I could've saved more women from going through the same. Anyway, for anyone who read this whole thing, thanks for reading and listening."
258,"I am currently having my story shared in the Australian and British press (such as¬†Sunday Heraldand¬†Scottish Sun) with regards to the murder investigation of Elly Warren. The Australian Federal Government will hopefully now push for an investigation into the Mozambique death of Elly Warren due partly to me sharing my own experience of dangers and police corruption of Tofo Beach, Mozambique. I am now in desperate need for your help to make future tourists, especially female, aware of these dangers. I am finding those in authority are desperately trying to protect the tourist industry of Tofo Beach at all costs, including covering up a murder and attempted rape. ¬†¬†

Apologies, there are many intricate components to this full story but let me try to explain.¬†

In 2010, I was involved in a serious incident metres from where Elly's body was found. To summarise, a Tofo¬†police officer¬†tried to rape and threatened to kill me. Thankfully I was able to escape. I then went to the police station, not knowing that my attacker was a police officer, to report the incident. At the police station, I identified my attacker who then proceeded to try to frame me with drug possession and told the other officers I had been resisting arrest when witnesses found me struggling with him. I was then held at gun point until bribe money was accepted and I was able to escape (for the second time in one night). The following days after this incident, I met with security representatives from the Mozambique Tourist Board and the British High Commissioner. I was continuously told to drop the case and be thankful that I wasn't being arrested, but I was determined to get justice. With two British Consular delegates present, I was able to identify my attacker and two other police officers involved. The day I returned home, I received a phone call to tell me the the police officer that had tried to attack me had lost his job, and more serious consequences were forthcoming. 

I was contacted a few weeks ago (20th of November) by the investigation team of Elly Warren due to our terrifying similarities. They had found a TripAdvisor post from 2010 that an eye-witness had written and were remarkably able to track me down. Elly was found dead in Tofo Beach in 2016, and has had a botched investigation due to the Mozambique police changing and concealing evidence. I am now directly working with Elly's family to fight for her justice and with the Australian Coroner's Court, providing them evidence such as secret audio recordings made from the police station. 

Upon learning of Elly's death, I immediately contacted the current Maputo British High Commissioner office for the names of the officers involved with my incident, but unfortunately, they have been less than helpful. I was coldly told they do not have the data for the case files from 2010 and they can also not tell me the names of the UK Officials working at that time. I have since been told this is because of the Data Protection Act. However, it still terrifies me for the potential reasons that the current British High Commissioner would know nothing about my incident: ¬†

  - That this is a normal occurrence: Tofo police rape tourists regularly so my case wasn't special
  - My case was hidden away to protect the tourist industry of Tofo Beach
  - No one actually did get fired and I was just told that so I would drop the case¬†

I believe the authorities who knew of my incident and didn't act, need to be held to some accountability for the murder of Elly Warren.¬† The tour company that I was with during my time in Africa also contacted me last week asking me not to publicise my story as I could prevent visitors going to Tofo. However, if the police cannot be trusted or are still a danger, then I have to draw awareness to this in case more woman suffer. ¬†

To clarify, I am not trying to single-handedly take on Mozambique's police corporation. At this stage, I just think it is in the upmost importance that I spread awareness for the safety of future tourists of Tofo. Although Mozambique is known for it's dangers, we are led to believe that Tofo Beach is a tourist paradise, a safe haven. From my experience, it appears that no authorities involved want to burst that paradise bubble.¬†People need to know that their daughters, sisters, and friends may not come home and no one will be willing to help them when that happens.¬†"
259,"I (22f) was sexually assaulted by a man I didn‚Äôt know at 7 years old. I told my older sister for the first time last week and it was the first time I‚Äôve ever told anyone. 

My mum was a heroin addict when I was growing up. She would always take me to drug houses, there was one we‚Äôd go to more than often. She would always tell me to just sit on the sofa and not to move. She‚Äôd then go to bedroom, use, usually be about an hour and then we‚Äôd leave. 

Usually there would be a few people there but this time when we went there was just the man (man A) and woman who lived there and one other man (man B) who I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd seen before. My mum went in the bedroom with the woman and her partner was in the kitchen, so I was alone in the living room with man B. I was sitting on the sofa with him but there was a gap between us. 

I knew that he kept watching me but I didn‚Äôt look at him, I just kept watching tv. Peppa pig was on (I fucking hate that pig so much üòÇ). He moved over to sit next to me and I remember pushing myself into the corner of the sofa as much I possibly could. He then started stroking my leg. I was wearing shorts and he put his hand up them and starting rubbing my vagina over my knickers. He then moved them to one side and kept rubbing while touching himself over his trousers. He then tried to put a finger inside. I don‚Äôt think he managed it completely but it did hurt. 

I remember I just couldn‚Äôt move. I couldn‚Äôt even move my eyes away from the tv. I was too scared to say anything or shout for my mum, party because I knew my mum would be angry for disturbing her, also just because I was scared of him and felt like I was doing something wrong. 

He then got my hand a put it under his pants and put his hand over mine and started masturbating with it. I remember it feeling really sweaty. I don‚Äôt really know how long it went on for. Could of only been 30 seconds. 

Man A was in the kitchen then walked in and saw what was going on and the Man B jumped and moved away from me. His zipper on his trousers cut my thumb. I pulled my shorts down so I was covered again. I have never felt so embarrassed before. Man A just looked at us both and said to me ‚Äúcome sit over here with me‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt straightaway but he asked me again and I did. He then said to Man B ‚ÄúI think you should leave‚Äù and the guy just nodded and got up. As he left he gave me a thumbs up. 

Man A told me to sit in the armchair and got me a drink. He didn‚Äôt saying anything about what happened just sat on the floor watching tv. I was really stressing about the cut on my hand and asked him if my mum was done. He said he‚Äôd check and came back and said she wasn‚Äôt done yet. Eventually we left. I was really worried about the cut because I thought it would be really dirty because of where my hand had been. I told my mum about the cut and she snapped at me and said ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a graze, stop being a baby‚Äù and spat on her hand and rubbed it.

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs weird but before I told my sister I‚Äôd never got upset or cried about it. Now I can‚Äôt stop. It‚Äôs constantly on my mind. I also don‚Äôt feel angry or anyway towards the man who assaulted me, I just feel angry to my mum because I shouldn‚Äôt have ever been there. Is that weird? I think it‚Äôs also important to say my mum was bused when she was a kid. I know her reaction will be, it‚Äôs not as bad as what happened to her. At least I wasn‚Äôt raped."
260,"Basically I was in a relationship where sometimes I did not want to have sex but because of the times I said no and the way he reacted - giving me the cold shoulder, ignoring me, sulking, and even once using the phrase ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna get a prostitute‚Äù- I ended up having sex/ doing sexual acts with him anyway because I didn‚Äôt want to deal with this negative side of him and because I was insecure (this was my first real relationship) And I wanted our relationship to last since we talked about getting married and being together forever. Is this coercion? Or is it my fault?"

 So, while in college I was in a relationship with someone who was physically and emotionally abusive. I got out of it, but later I found out he had raped two girls that I knew. One of them asked me about him, and asked if the same thing had happened to me. It hadn‚Äôt, but I had a huge amount of guilt and wished I had done something to report him.

This was over ten years ago. I don‚Äôt think about it very often. I‚Äôm happily married with kiddos. 

I recently reconnected with an acquaintance, who was tangentially related to that friend group. Through a conversation about our time in college, some weird things came to light. 

It turns out my ex got drunk and confessed to some of his friends that he once raped me while I was unconscious. He said I said no, we fought, he hit me, I later passed out from drinking too much, and he raped me. 

I don‚Äôt have any memory of this. But I think it‚Äôs probably true. And I guess I don‚Äôt know how to feel? I‚Äôm sort of horrified, but also I‚Äôm not that person anymore... I‚Äôm trying to process.

I‚Äôm really hurt that people knew. They knew and didn‚Äôt care. The knew and didn‚Äôt try to help me. And then so many people acted like I was crazy when we broke up. And it feels so weird and invasive that so many people knew this awful thing and I had no idea."
262,"‚ÄîBackground‚Äî My sexual assaulter is a family member. I was sexually battered & then later solicited from ages 12ish-17. It took me until I was 19 to even mention it to my parents. To ‚Äúmaintain peace‚Äù he was still invited to events as recently as 5 yrs ago, this has caused me EXTREME stress, fear, and trauma. Not to mention the utter invalidation & betrayal Ive felt. After therapy I gathered courage to confront his mother about his actions. She said she believed me & also believed I wasnt the only girl.... That conversation was 2016. I have not seen him since then thankfully. 


‚ÄîCurrent‚Äî After battling mental health issues Ive FINALLY earned my degree!! I invited my aunt & would you know that she brought my assaulter without mentioning it to anyone? I look up to the stands scanning for my family & suddenly my heart stops cold. His face is there waving & smiling.  Furiously I message my parents from my seat saying I will be exiting as soon as the ceremony is over & not participating in anything. Because I know they will want to ‚Äúkeep the peace‚Äù I decide to message my aunt directly. They had driven 5 hrs to see me & I told them to leave. I DID IT. I STOOD UP FOR ME. They left but of course my aunt sent an awful message about how I need to ‚Äúget over this & heal‚Äù. 


‚ÄîClosing message‚Äî If it matters to you then it matters! Put your own feelings first & fuck ‚Äúkeeping the peace‚Äù. It may take a long time to stick up for yourself because yes it‚Äôs scary but at the same time it‚Äôs the biggest act of self love there is."
263,"My mom doesn't understand what it's like to be scared to move, scared to walk through the halls at school, scared to be in bed. She doesn't know what it's like to panic when the door creaks open, even if it's just because the house is old and shifts at night.
She doesn't know what it's like to completely shut down after an episode of flashbacks hits so hard you feel as if you'll never get up again. She doesn't know the pain of shouting for help, only to hear no response, to look in your abusers eyes and see no light, she doesn't know how terrifying it is for your abuser to be your own goddamn brother. 
How does she expect me to forgive and forget when he chases me in my sleep as well as in my waking moments? Why does she think it's that easy?
Part of me wishes CPS had just taken me away, that I hadn't lied when they came and questioned me. I told them it wasn't as bad as it is. They left, I'm all alone, my parents don't believe me when it happens again, say that he's changed, that I'm the delusional one. Sometimes I feel so alone. 
If it had started later, if I had shouted louder, if I had locked my door, those are the sentence starters from hell. They never mean well when they say those things. If they are so bad, why do I tell myself those things? If only I knew
I'm so scared, all the time."

265,"For all the people that don‚Äôt understand what victim blaming is, here‚Äôs some examples of what victim blaming would look like in other legal situations:

Most used example of victim blaming:

‚ÄúI was raped‚Äù 
‚ÄúWell what were you wearing‚Äù

Now the alternatives:

‚ÄúA drunk driver hit my mom and killed her while she was driving‚Äù
‚ÄúWell what was she driving‚Äù

‚ÄúI was robbed‚Äù
‚ÄúWell where was your wallet?

‚ÄúMy son was murdered‚Äù
‚ÄúWell was he outside alone?‚Äù

‚ÄúI got hit by a car‚Äù
‚ÄúWell were you crossing the street?‚Äù

Do you see how the question asked has absolutely no relevancy to the situation and simultaneously doesn‚Äôt explain why the crime occurred?? Does this make sense to anyone out there? I‚Äôm genuinely curious if this will help people understand why that‚Äôs a stupid question to ask rape victims.

Also, for everyone that asks survivors ‚ÄúWhY dID it TaKe YoU SO loNg To SaY SOmeThInG??‚Äù Well, victim blaming. 99% of the time that I‚Äôve told people about my sexual assaults, they find a way to make it somehow my fault for existing rather than it being the perpetrators fault. What isn‚Äôt making sense to these people? People that commit the crimes are the people that are at fault and should receive punishment and social judgement and shame for such crimes, not the victim. There‚Äôs zero ways that a person can deserve, bring on, or instigate abuse onto themself.

TL;DR  

There‚Äôs zero ways that a person can deserve, bring on, or instigate abuse onto themself. Sexual assault is never the result of a victims actions/appearance, but rather, it‚Äôs the result of the perpetrators decisions and actions. 

Regardless of any precautions a victim did/did not take, in order to not be sexually assaulted, none of those things excuse, explain, or  justify them being sexually assaulted.

It is NEVER the victims responsibility to not be sexually assaulted. It‚Äôs the sexual abusers responsibility to not sexually abuse people. 
The same way that it‚Äôs not someone‚Äôs responsibility to not get robbed, rather, it‚Äôs the robbers responsibility to not rob. And when someone gets robbed, the robber is at fault, and is the one that gets criminally punished and socially shamed, rather than the victim."
266,"&#x200B;

""Women speaking up against sexual harassment are often disbelieved, often asked, ‚Äúwhat proof do you have?‚Äù Other questions women face include: ‚ÄúWhy did you not speak up immediately after it happened?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhy did you take to media or social media to tell your story, instead of filing a criminal case?‚Äù The Ramani judgement is worth celebrating because for once, a court of law took on the burden of offering a definitive answer to these questions. Survivors and feminist activists will now find their burden a little lighter: They will be able to ask all questioners to find the answers in this landmark judgement.

The verdict urged society to ‚Äúunderstand that sometimes a victim may for years not speak up due to mental trauma,‚Äù and underlined that a woman has a right to speak up about the abuse, even after decades. It pointed out that since sexual harassment typically takes place in private, women‚Äôs testimonies cannot be dismissed as untrue or defamatory simply because they are unable to provide other witnesses to back their allegations.""

267,"So when I was about 7, my cousin (around 17 at the time) sexually abused me multiple times. I won‚Äôt go into details because it makes me sick to my stomach thinking about it. 

Today I read a post on an Instagram page of a girl sharing her own story and the last line said ‚Äúyou can decide your own family‚Äù. This hit me hard and I opened up Facebook to his page. Why do I have him on Facebook you might ask? Because my comfort is trying not to acknowledge that anything happened and that all is normal. 

I was SO close to unfriending him as a big ‚Äúfuck you, I remember what you did‚Äù but I started tearing up because I couldn‚Äôt do it. And I think I know why now. It‚Äôs because I‚Äôll be letting go of the illusion that my family is perfect and normal and that nothing ever happened. It‚Äôs because I‚Äôll be fully acknowledging that what happened actually happened. I won‚Äôt be living a lie anymore. 

I think I just need a little more time to come to terms with it. I know it happened a long time ago as I am now 23 but I‚Äôm livid that it still affects me this much. He caused so much pain in my life and I feel uncomfortable with most of the men in my family because of it. 

No one in my family knows. I‚Äôve only told a couple close friends and my current bf. I‚Äôve already made a whole separate post on why I haven‚Äôt told anyone else so if you wanna read that you can I don‚Äôt feel like I need to get into that again. 

Also the kicker? I scrolled through his page and back when #saveourchildren was just emerging, he shared a couple photos. One says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just saying if we start hanging pedophiles in the streets now, they will make great Halloween decorations in October‚Äù and the other says ‚ÄúPedophilia is not a sexual orientation. Touch my kids and I will murder you with my bare hands and smile in the courtroom‚Äù. Ironic. 

Thank you for reading. And remember, you can decide your own family."
268,"After 40 years of silence, I made a police report, and have a video statement date."
269,"I can't speak for anyone else, only myself. 

I don't know if anyone else felt this way at the shock and outrage over the MeToo movement, but I remember, amongst the horror, I felt anger. Yes, for the rapists. But also for people who were shocked. Surprised. Who didn't know such things went on in Hollywood, or daily life. I was angry at them, too. I thought... 'You SERIOUSLY didn't know how bad this is?'.

I was 14 the first time a friend told me they'd been raped. In retrospect I think I've always been easy to talk to, who listens, who's approachable. I realise now it's not really the norm for women to feel like they can talk openly and honestly with men, but for whatever reason they've felt that way with me.

I remember the shock, the horror I felt as I listened to her graphic description of being held down, raped, burnt with cigarettes. I'd never heard anything like this. And most importantly, I hadn't experienced anything in my own life as a man or boy that I could compare it to. I think that's why a lot of men struggle to empathise. They don't hear about it, they don't experience it, they can't understand it in relation to their own life.

It took me a lot of time, listening to my friend, the descriptions of the violence, the behaviour, her feelings then and now. I understood it on its own terms, not mine. But it took me time. She's doing great now, and says that my support through that time was a vital part of her getting through it, so that helps to salve my feeling of hopelessness, the idea that I could help, in some small way. Still, it's not much by comparison to what she went through.

Then something odd started happening, to me. Within a year, now 15, another friend told me she had been raped. She told me, out of the blue. And I listened. I supported. I sat through the horror all over again and said nothing about how I felt. For anyone who counsels a friend through this, I think that's good advice. This was all a daily ritual. It was not a single conversation, for either of my friends. It was day after day after day, for years now. That's what gets a friend through this; being there. Not having been there once.

That year another friend confessed to me that she had been raped. Next year it was another two. And it continued. That was 11 years ago. The number of friends, family and partners who have been raped now stands at 21. I keep count. And I remember them all. Half of those, I was the first person they told. Five told their parents. Three the police. Only one had their rapist arrested and imprisoned. He's already out now.

Now about every 8 months someone close to me tells me about their experience being raped. I have seen, in the long term, the damage that does to a person. Their life is fractured, broken, able only to reknit into a deformed, twisted version of what it was meant to be. I have grown up seeing people I love unravel like this, and I know without a doubt that there is no act of violence more damaging than rape.

One friend was 13 years old when she was pulled into a van and gang-raped by five men. My step-mother was abducted, stripped naked, chained to the floor in a collar and forced to eat from the dog bowl as he raped her over a period of 8 hours. He assembled knives and barbed wire and described how, when he was done with her, he would execute her. My girlfriend was raped habitually by her father from the age of about 8 until he was too infirm to continue, about ten years later. Then she took care of him until he died. She told me she used to be stoned by the local bullies on her way home from school, and would still drag her feet because she knew the real abuse waited for her at home.

Even with MeToo's massive push recently, I haven't heard any stories like this in the media. We don't hear the worst. And we aren't reminded often enough that this happens EVERYWHERE, not just Hollywood. It's hard not to feel hopeless. I've been hearing these stories since I was a kid myself, and it's hard living with that knowledge. But not as hard as it for the victims to live with. So I know how lucky I am. 

But rape has touched almost every best friend, family member and partner I've ever had. I was not shocked when the news came out, and I still feel angry at those who were. How so much suffering can persist without so many people knowing is beyond me. When a female friend tells me she's never been harassed or raped... That's when I'm surprised. I often feel that if you're a woman, you are guaranteed to experience it at some point in your life.

In truth, I'm heartbroken, permanently, knowing how much suffering is out there. But I am hopeful. A lot of people are painfully ignorant of this, but they're learning. A lot of rapists have hurt a lot of people, but they're being taken down. And a lot of victims are hurting, but they are being listened to.

If you are a victim yourself, just know that millions of people can feel your pain, and hear your voice. None of us can give back what was taken from you, but we are here to help, to support, to listen. And I know that a male friend is an unlikely choice for a confidant, but we are out here too. You might be discovering now that far more people are ready to be there for you than you could have imagined.

My perspective is not one of a victim, but I think it's important to hear. I struggle to hope, a lot. It's hard not to fear for others around me. And I find myself silently waiting to hear confession number 22 with a pained sense of dread.

But I'm always here to listen. And victim or not, the rest of us should all be ready to do the same. Because that's the only antidote to this kind of pain."
270,"Hi. So this happened just before COVID-19. I had this math teacher that was new and for some reason he took interest in me. As I later discovered, he'd obsess over me in other classes, telling people how smart I was. He also always gave me compliments and snacks, and honestly, I thought he was just super nice. One day in class, he called me up to the white board to answer a question. When I was done he grabbed my shoulders and moved me very, very close to him. He talked to the class about how great I was at math. Being shy, I wanted to leave already and for him to shut up. But then, he slowly rubbed his dick against my butt. He was hard. It terrified me. No one even noticed. Even though that event was so small, it sent me spiraling down an intense fear of sexual assault, and for some reason, I feel so sure that I will be raped one day. I don't even have a reason to believe it but every time I am around someone who's bigger than me I'm terrified and it's the first thing on my mind. How do I prevent rape or the fear of it? Such a bland question, I know, but I just feel like there's something I need to know, because rn I'm so lost. Thanks in advance :).

If this post isn't following a rule or smth, please let me know, first time sharing this story :)"

News:
If you haven‚Äôt been paying attention to the internet over the last few days, James Charles the YouTube celebrity has been dropping subscribers at a record breaking pace. 

At the moment of writing this he has dropped from 16,572,726 down to 13,873,000.

Now there are plenty of videos and articles out there explaining many of factors that have seen this dramatic drop off. But today I wanted to list why James Charles is the epitome of the #MeToo Movement.

Number 1: In a video by his former mentor, Tati, she tells the story about her birthday party where Charles speaks openly and disgustingly about the sexual acts he wishes to perform on a waiter, whom Tati describes as a straight boy. He spoke clear and loud enough for many at the birthday party to hear him. Worst of all when confronted by his mentor about how inappropriate that language and behaviour is, Charles states ‚Äú I‚Äôm famous‚Äù. Using your power and stature to sexually harass and demean a human being just trying to make a living, sounds very Weinstein to me!

Number 2: In other videos on YouTube Charles has collaborated with other up and coming stars of the internet platform. Collections are being put together by commentator channel left, right and center where Charles is joking openly about trying to manipulate and ‚Äútrick‚Äù young vulnerable boys into performing acts on him or allowing him to perform sexual acts on them. It‚Äôs shown in these videos that Charles uses his fame and money to do ‚Äúfavors‚Äù for these young boys. Such as flights and tickets to events, alcohol or ‚Äúclout‚Äù. Then turning around and publicly shaming them online and in some cases, where brave young boys have come forward, shamed them privately. Suggesting by taking the gifts and ‚Äúkindness‚Äù he has given them the boys are using him and being a ‚Äúcock tease‚Äù. Again very #MeToo.

Number 3: perhaps the best insight into how this predator works is through a video made by Gage Gomez where he gave the following statement,
""James then saw this as an opportunity to manipulate me as a person who may or may not have been trying to figure things out about their sexuality, after the fact of telling him that I was straight multiple times. He then started to begin putting a little bit of pressure on me, of getting to know me without ... like, disregarding the fact that I told him I was straight. Because as you all know this person 99.9, maybe even 100 percent of times, goes after heterosexual men. I told James I wasn't interested in any of that.""

Charles has since come out condemning the victims comments and saying
‚ÄúYou're straight but flew to Coachella to try and see if you wanted to be with me? And kissed me there? You realize that doesn't make you look great, right?‚Äù

Shaming/Blaming a victim or sexual harassment and manipulation is just yet another parallel we can draw to the #MeToo Movement.

We need all supporters from all over the spectrum to come out and support these victims of harassment and sexual harassment and to condemn yet another powerful and famous white male with money for taking advantage!"
272,"Sorry for the long read:

It's been just a year short of a decade now when this assault occurred. I'll start from the beginning, cuz I dont want people to only hear about the disgusting act, but what lead to it and why I've been quiet.

He was my childhood bestfriend, up untill around 5 years old and then he moved away. We did not keep in contact, but every now and again he and his family would visit. His family and mine were all church members together, so during that time in our younger years we spent a lot of time together. We had crushes on each other and ended up kissing each other. Then our parrents caught us, so obviously we had a lecture. But the last thing he said to me as they all were saying their goodbyes to us, was ""my favorite color isnt red anymore, its white."" I know....sounds silly now. But back then, red was both our favorite color and was some weird bond we had, and I remember being crushed by it.

Fast forward to my teen years, right before 16, his older brother came back home to visit for the summer, as his dad lived there again. We had gotten close, just as friends, but we had some great laughs together. That continued for another two summers. He eventually got married, and I was happy for him. But summer of 2011, both brothers came to visit. And this was the first time I'd seen this guy in years. I was 19. I thought it would be a romantic connection, because he remembered me and our childhood friendship. So we hung out a couple of times, and then he took me on a date. But then July 3rd, he invited me to come see him where he was staying. I am not sure why he was at this place, it was a group of cabins literally in the middle of nowhere 45 min away from where I lived at the time, it was night. He, I guess was watching the place for the owners, idk....I ended back there years later for a job, and I felt sick being there again....

So anyways, I arrive and hes there with A LOT of beer and was pushing me to keep drinking. No food, was pretty cold, and felt weird, but given our past, I was trusting. I eventually drank so much I could barely walk, then we made out for like a min and then he was handsy and was ready to do the deed. I wasn't ready, just wanted to take things slow, but I remember distinctly saying no and pushing him off (or at least trying to with my noodle arms). Somehow we were in his bed and my pants are off. He didnt talk, just seemed in the zone and only cared about getting his di** in. I wondered to myself if he was planning this all along, and tried to ask if this was all he wanted from me, but I think all that I could really get out was ""you brought a condom?"" Not asking for sex. But i see how he could have taken that as consent. Even though I still kept saying no. I passed out, and when I woke up it was like 6 in the morning. I wanted to get out as fast as possible. So I drove home.

When I get home, it was basically trying to put myself back together since I had a full day of plans ahead of me. I was bleeding alot (not on my period) so I had to use a maxipad. I was hungover as shit, roaring headache and just wanted to curl up in bed and cry. 

That day I still had to see him again, and his brother. His brother invited me to a BBQ at his dad's place - so I felt like I needed to suck it up, all the emotions were just pesky to me at the time. On the drive there the guy called his girlfriend (yup, didnt know about that) and they talked for a bit. WITH ME IN THE CAR. So i tried to be normal, but then just wanted to leave right away, so i did. Didnt see him again after that. Nor his brother, which still saddens me to this day, we were good friend. But because of his brother I couldn't even talk to him. I blamed myself, I felt like trash, and a fool. I thought he'd be mad, and tell my family. 

My dad found out a year later, and took it upon himself to ""fix"" it. He got the police (a church memeber), our minister and the guy's dad involved without my permission. They sent me into councling and his dad paid for it. So I guess it was all settled in their mind. But the whole thing was so stressful it set off a chain of events, and I suspect that's why I am as sick as I am today, PTSD, anxiety, Lupus, and more...starting 2011 up till now. 

Short version: childhood bestfriend comes back into my life in 2011, gets me wasted and then rapes me so hard I bleed all the next day. Then my dad got involved, who then got the police and minister involved without my permission (I was 19 at the time). I still deal with the PTSD and anxiety to this day, everyday. The councling was just so the guy could be off the hook, cuz I was getting ""fixed"" with a few weeks of therapy."
273,"This issue was recently brought to my attention and I felt like it was important to discuss on this platform. I have two very close friends who were depicted in a comic by another friend. Later on I found out this artist didn‚Äôt actually know one of these subjects he was drawing very well at all. That disturbed me because the comic is about the two of them, naked for the whole story, running around and being silly and lewd. I told the artist I really hoped he had gotten explicit consent from my friends to draw them naked. I haven‚Äôt heard back. He‚Äôs created two issues of this comic of my naked friends. This made me analyze yet another layer of consent. If an artist wants to render an image of a REAL person they need consent from that person. Just as if they were a photographer, rendering an image needs consent if there is nudity or sexual content involved. No ifs ands or buts. I understand artistic freedom etc but creating something that symbolizes that person without their consent is the same thing as posting naked pictures without getting permission."
274,"Let me start out by saying that I am a man, and a gay man at that, but I was raped by a woman shortly after accepting the fact that maybe I was not straight. I was depressed because I didn't want to be gay. I was in a fraternity, and I just thought that being gay in a fraternity would be weird. My fraternity supported me immensely through it though. I love those guys. But one night before I told some of them I got very, very drunk. Not quite blackout, but close. This girl who is in a sorority was hanging out with me and a couple other guys. She didn't drink. After I get blasted she takes me outside behind a building close by and pulls down my pants. I was uncomfortable and didn't want her to. I said no a few times but gave up because I couldn't even walk at this point. We had sex in the snow. I was a virgin at that point, but not anymore. I wanted my first time to be with another guy that I could trust. Now what bothers me more than anything else, is how all these people knew about it, didn't stop it, and it became a joke. The next day she came over and asked if I wanted to hang out. I said ""What, so you can rape me again?"" And everyone laughed. If I was a woman and she was a guy then she would be labeled a monster, kicked out of college, and arrested. But apparently to most people women can't rape men.The double standard pisses me off so much. If I took advantage of a drunk girl like she took advantage of me, everyone would hate me. And if I ever complained about it people told me to ""man up"" and ""quit being a pussy"". This double standard needs to end. Just because I am a guy doesn't mean I can't get raped by a woman, and it sure as hell doesn't invalidate my right to be fucking pissed. I find this whole situation similar to news stories where teachers sleep with students. If it's a male teacher sleeping with a female student, people want him dead or in ptison for life. If it's an attractive female teacher sleeping with a male student, people are like ""Good for that kid! Wish I had a teacher like that!"" NO! NONONONONO! WOMEN CAN BE RAPISTS TOO! I get men are statistically more likely to rape than women, but it doesn't change the fact that I was raped by a woman. This double standard needs to go. I'm sick of it. Rant over."
275,"This happened in 2001. I worked in an auto parts store, hard enough as a female. We were hanging sale signs from wooden dowels. My coworker took one of those dowels and ran it up between my legs. It was witnessed by 2 other employees and I immediately screamed and said what the f*** are you doing and he just shrugged and laughed. I told the manager and he said I misunderstood what happened. That made me angry so I called the general manager and that employee got fired. I then got transfered to another store in another city and put on closing shift. Finally after 4 months of moving shifts and trying to get closer to home because of my newborn, and failing, I quit. 4 days after I quit he was back to work. I never called them on it because I felt so defeated. And I've never gone back to auto parts, even though I loved it."
276,"I am working on a class project in which people who have survived sexual abuse/harassment can have a place to talk with other survivors anonymously. I am hoping to start a community on this site, but am new to this site and need the Karma points.. hence the point of this post. Please help me out by upvoting so I can create this community."
277,"Don‚Äôt do it. It‚Äôs harassment. One in five women have been raped in their life and unprecedented advances like this are more than likely not welcome. If you encounter a woman, especially if she is at work, do not call her anything different than something you‚Äôd call a man in the same position. Things like sweetie, sweetheart, honey, baby, mama, cutie, or any other inappropriate name are completely unacceptable, and if she is on the clock and reacts positively or negatively she could very well risk losing her job."
278,"This is the story of how my mother found out about my story. I had this friend who was a compulsive liar. She also didn't know what was okay to tell a counsellor and what wasn't. News flash for her, MY story was not something you tell other people. She told the counsellor, blamed it on my friend and suddenly I was in a room with child services, a camera and an officer being forced to tell my story. Then the neighbours were being interviewed by docs, then us. The neighbours (obviously) didn't take kind to this and stole our bins. Skank face (big mouth friend) got mad at me for being angry at her. Got the counsellor and our year adviser involved (telling him in the process) and she pulled out the tears and suddenly I am the bad guy bc 'she was looking out for me'. I don't believe that bc she has outed one of my gay friends to the WHOLE SCHOOL. Then told their rape story to me included. I don't know if I should still hate her. Teachers are judgemental about me still hating her.  Please share your thoughts bc I am confused on how I should feel about her."
279,"When I was just 4 years old, my mother had gotten with this one guy. They were together 13 years. He was abusive to my mom, my brother, and me. Mental, physical, and sexual (sexually abusive to me and my mom). My mom never knew though. She still doesn't know everything. When I was 9 a movie had come out that had a rape scene. We were always raised to turn our heads while the nasty scenes played in movies. But one day, little curious me decided not to turn away. I got caught looking and got in trouble. Later that night. My mom's boyfriend comes to me while I'm sleeping and lays with me, which he'd never done before. He would just slightly put his hand in my shirt but it never got passed that. Fast forward about a year, I still never said anything. I was scared as he's gang affiliated and always talked about how he'd hurt ANYONE that tried getting in the way of his freedom. Anyways, about a year later it starts progressing. Now he's at the point where he plays with himself as he touches me, rubs himself against my behind, etc.. and it stayed like that for the longest time. Once I hit about 7th or 8th grade it got to where he was physically penetrating me. I always acted like I was sleeping. I was frozen. Every. Single. Time. Fast forward a few more years. 15 now.............I end up pregnant by him....... I tell my mom that i dont know who the dad is and she calls me all kinds of names. Whore, slut, all of it. I keep the baby and give birth at 16. He still lives with us and still assaults me. Up until I turned 18. My mom and him had gotten into a big fight over something not related to the assaults. They ended up splitting... I still didn't tell my mom until maybe two months after he left. I am now 21 (current day as I am typing) I suffer from PTSD every day of my life. There isn't a day that my assaults cross my mind. The one that was supposed to step up as a dad stepped right on my fragile heart and broke my spirit. PLEASE if you are getting assaulted PLEASE say something. I wish I would've when it first started. I was robbed the whole beginning of my life because of a piece of scum. PLEASE don't make the same mistake I did by not saying anything. You have a voice, please use it. I didn't use mine and now I'm 21 trying to find who I am because I never had the chance, because I never spoke up. PLEASE SEEK HELP IF YOU ARE BEING ASSAULTED"
280,I was 14 and he was 21/22. He used me for sexual stuff (online) ext ext and then he left me and i was really emotionally dependent on him so it really hurt me. But today I confronted him and he told me that i told him i was 19. AND LIKE A TOTAL BADASS i sent him a screenshot of me telling him my age when i was 14. IT FELT SO GOOD.
281,"***Trigger warning!!*** Rape, graphic. 

This is my first time publicly sharing this story.


When I was 15 I started dating my abusive and manipulative ex. In less than a year he had convinced me that every argument we ever had was my fault, that he was too good for me and that I was lucky to have him. He never said any of those things out right, he was very smooth with his wording, and it was a slow manipulative process. 

Just over a year after we started dating, when I was 16 my ex stayed home from ""sick"". Since we had a lot of classes together and everyone, including teachers, knew we were dating (small town school) he asked me to get his homework for the day and bring it to him. I did what he asked and brought them to his house after school. He asked me to stay and told me his parents weren't home, but they would be home soon. So I texted my mom and sat down with him on the couch. At the time I was a devout catholic and wholeheartedly believed in waiting till marriage for sex. He knew that. 
He started kissing me and feeling me up and asked me if I wanted to. I said no, feeling very uncomfortable. He asked again. I said no. He asked again, and again, and again. I said no every time, now trying to think of a reason to leave. 
Then he said ""Your god will understand because we love each other and he knows that.""
I saw no way out, he was on top of me, he was stronger than me, we were alone. I said yes. He put on a condom and took off my pants. And it hurt so bad I was crying, but I never said anything. He thought I was crying from joy and went harder. 
After he was done I left without saying a word to him and drove to a nature overlook outside my town. I cried for over an hour. He stole my virginity. And that wouldnt be the last time he raped me either. He pulled the same trick two more times before I found out he was cheating on me. 
I broke up with him because he was cheating, not because he was abusive or I was unhappy and suicidal. Because he cheated. 

It wasnt until I was dating my now husband and going through therapy for the trauma I experienced as a young child that I learned what he did was rape. 

I said yes. But I was raped. This is something we have to make sure our children know about."
282,"Pretty much what the title says...

The past 2 months have been an ongoing investigation at work to try and fire this guy  (almost 10 years older than me - I'm 18) for harassing me and touching me unsolicitedly. 

For 2 months or so he nagged me into submitting to showing him suggestive pictures of me in lingerie or naked - pictures I have kept for my partner's uses. He never listened when I told him ""no I don't want to"", instead telling me that ""you know you want to"" and other things along those lines. I have a history of being forced into something I didn't want to do from an ex-partner and a few years afterwards from a friend of a friend, so I'm not very strong against standing up to sexual encounters. 

This guy would isolate me and touch and smack my ass, grab my breasts and lift up my shirt when I didn't want him to. I finally worked up the courage to report him, wrote my statement including exact dates, potential CCTV and witnesses but I lost...

I lost. This was more than just a chance to win over him. It was a chance to finally empower myself (besides the very trusting intercourse I have with my partner because he makes me feel valued and respected - wholeheartedly, he's a sweetheart) by bringing him to justice and finally getting some kind of victory for my sexually abusive history. 

I'm going to get a new job... But it could take a while and I can't be unemployed while looking for a new one. So I must suck it up and work beside my assaulter/harasser until I can leave.

Edit: just wanted to thank everyone who has replied so far and anyone else who will. Discussing this with you guys is helping so much to clear my head and slow down and reassess the situation in a not-so-doomed light. I hope that those of you with cases of your own win them if you are currently fighting one and that you can learn to push through this struggle and reclaim yourself whether or not you've won a case, lost a case are currently in dispute,or haven't spoken up. Whether you have one incident of sexual abuse or many: well some to all of you for getting through this even enough to be here and seeing this post today. Thank you and stay strong!

Update: my uncle may be able to get me transferred to another store. He is friends with a manager at a nearby branch of the fast food company I work for. The manager is going to try and get me transferred or push for my store to get back on the case and fight against the legal firm! 

Update 2 (final): I feel it's needed. The man who did this quit his job about a month or so ago as a result of the case. I am happy at work now and am pushing myself forward in my training to work up the ranks as far as I can! Besides the passing memories and ocassional mentions of the man's name, I don't remember that this situation ever happened. I'm not completely over it as being used in any way is quite disheartening to say the least. However I want to use this as an example that it is possible to move on from events in your life that happen; be they sexual or not. I know that my situation was not as bad as others here man have experienced and so they will be more difficult to overcome. But difficult does not mean impossible. Thank you to everyone who gave support and know that I am on your side too, as well as the side of everyone else on this sub! "
283,"I was living with my boyfriend and his brother and his mom at the time and I was in my boyfriend's bed sleeping. I woke up to my boyfriend kissing me it was a little different but I was like half asleep so I went with it as I didn't think about the difference. I totally forgot he had a twin. We end up having sex with me assuming he was my boyfriend which he wasnt. I was half asleep and it was dark as hell. I can tell the difference between them when I talk to them or see how they look and their demeanor. But I couldn't in the dark and shit, I have never and will never ever like him in anyway especially sexually. He is a prick and an addict. I would never have had sex with him had I known who he was and didn't realize tell after when I heard his voice I freaked out. I don't knwo how to feel because It was consentual but I only did it because I thought it was my boyfriend..."
284,"I was probably 6-7 years old if I were to guess. He would have been between 13-15 years old I remember him telling me that he'd kill my parents if I told anyone. I remember going to many doctors appointments, getting tested. I remember him playing with himself in his basement, asking me to try ""it"". I remember this stupid fuck getting away with it because they couldn't do something with the evidence. I don't remember exactly why he got away with it, but I remember feeling so fucking defeated.

I haven't come out with this, but I did today. Why? Because facebook showed him as ""someone you may know."" Yes, Facebook, I remember him very well. I've kept this thing pressed deep down for at least 15-18 years.

I just wanted to share this. Thanks for reading.

285,"So I was looking for a good gift for my sister on amazon and I typed in college girl gifts, and you know what kept popping up mace and tasers, and lots of pocket knifes along with bear alarms that are recommended to use to attract attention Incase of assault, I feel really disgusted that we as a society are saying ‚Äúhey girls wanna feel safe on campus, carry a weapon!‚Äù But to guys we say almost nothing don‚Äôt arm girls make boys more knowledgeable and teach them about consent and to not fucking assault women!!!

286,"Hello all,

I experienced an incident 12 years ago.  Heads up- I'm going to describe the incident, but not go into a lot of graphic detail. 

My ex deliberately broke my boundaries during sex and said he was doing it cause he kind of hates me. I didn't say anything. I didn't know how to feel. We were breaking up at the time and he was angry at me. I kind of didn't want the sex at all and gave in to pressure. Then he deliberately violated a stated boundary while verbally acknowledging he was doing it. I stopped talking to him soon after that and moved far away but never acknowledged the incident. A year later he contacted me and threatened suicide if we didn't get back together. He also described how he was going to put his cats to sleep unless I moved back and tried again with him. And I said no but told him to get help and I hoped he felt better. I never told him how manipulative cruel and messed up he was being.

So now, 12 years later after much therapy and emotional growth, my anger about these incidents has surfaced and I don't know what to do with it. In a normal situation, I'd just tell the person, ""What you did was messed up, etc."" But this is so many years later. Is there any point? Plus I'm really not interested in anything he has to say. Best case scenario would be an apology and I just can't bring myself to want to hear it. Worst case will be some kind of argument about how I was wrong too, blah blah. I mean, yes I didn't break up with him gracefully and I could have been better in a lot of ways. But I did not violate his sexual boundary. He did that, so....

I don't know exactly what I want to get out of it except for having a voice. Like, I don't think my pointing it out will change his behavior if he hasn't changed on his own in all this time. Also, he blocked me from his life and social media after he theatened sucide ‚Äãand I didn't move back to be with him. 

I just hope to hear from others who experienced something a long time ago. Did you confront the person after all that time? If you did, did it give you any satisfaction? How else did/do you deal with the anger?

Thank you for listening. This is hard to talk about and I appreciate you all reading it.

"
287,"Sorry for the long post but this is my anon confession. 

Only like 3 people irl who know that I was assaulted. 

Background: I grew up in a neglect situation, and there was this couple from my church who knew my family had issues so they sort of took me in. This was when I was 11. I never actually lived with them full time, and they never legally adopted me, but I thought of them as my adopted family. He was a college professor, and helped me get into his uni. on a scholarship. He was my academic advisor, research advisor, scholarship spokesperson, and really, my ""dad"". 

One summer I went on a trip with him to do some collaborative research at another school. I was 19. He ended up insisting I stay in the hotel room with him, where there was only one bed. Stuff happened. It was awful.

I wanted to run away but I was in strange city in a bad part of town. I wanted to tell him to stop, but I just couldn't comprehend what was happening. I idolized him and he had complete control over my life. 

This person was my whole world. I went to a small school, and everyone knew I was close with him and that he was like my adopted dad. He was well known and respected, he won all kinds of teaching awards, was on lots of different boards. Hell, he helped plant a church in town. I honestly dont think anyone would have believed me. 

Even if they DID believe me, then what? He would be fired. But I dont think technically anything was illegal since I was 19 and we aren't legally related. And he didnt rape me, just... other stuff. 

His family would have been ripped apart. His wife was like mom to me, and she had no idea. I couldn't tell her. It's not her fault. I dont ever want her to know.  If they got divorced and their kids got split up over me, I dont know if I could live with that.

So I pretended it never happened. For years. And I think he was a bit on edge that I would report him, so he never tried to do anything again, and we never talked about it. A few years later I decided to move away, and I cut off contact. It really hurt, especially since my ""mom"" and ""siblings"" had no idea why and probably still dont.

When the whole #metoo wave swept over, it was extremely emotional for me. I was glad people were coming forward, but knew it wasnt possible for me. So here's as close as I've gotten. 

#metoo"
288,"I realize this wont be a popular point of view for some people but i think this need to be talked about.

So the ""Me too"" movement is something that is all around us now. When it first came out, all the men that were shown to be the way they were was a good think for the most part such as what happened with louis CK and other famous people.

Over the past week however, i seen people which as Stan Lee and now recently James Franco. There comes a point where you have to rethink if what is really happening is just being abused. Lets look at these 2

1. Stan lee is 95 years old, why are these coming out now?!? Do we not realize old people are just the way they are and its shouldnt be anything. You know what you are dealing with when Stan lee plays a Strip Club DJ in Deadpool. 

2. James Franco- This came out not to long ago. I watched his interview on seth meyers and Colbert's and i can read that he for sure is aware of what happened. James Franco is a hot name right now and its human nature to Drag people down for money, just like the Stan lee example. 

The confusing thing which is happening is that what do we define what the difference between Flirting and what someone would call ""sexual harassment"" This line between these two have become blurry and thats a dangerous hole to go down. I just feel like some people will abuse this victimizing tactic against people who are rich.  We need to look at each case and not paint all people as sick because that will destroy the social life between us and make it harder to live life.  Let me know your thoughts because there comes a point where you have to have second thoughts. "
289,"He was a ""friend"" I met in college (he always wanted more). Weirdness started when I would have him over drinking (recovering alcoholic here). Give him the couch and wake up to him in my bed. 
One time I woke up to him touching me.
I also went through a couple disturbing events leading me to believe he raped me, probably more than once. I wouldn't have any idea how many times I was drunk and passed out around him.. a lot. 
A lot of the time I wonder if I'm making a bigger deal out of it than I should. My story isn't as bad as others... etc.

I fortunately have Facebook messages from him that day admitting everything. They are now evidence."
290,I'm a freshman in high school and I started dating this guy December of 2019 and a day or 2 before new years eve he fingered me really roughly and the day after I think I had little tears and it hurt to pee or even touch it. On New Years eve I decided it would be ok to have sex because new years eve would be a special day and my best friend already lost it but it still hurt a lot and we barley even had sex. Next a couple times that we hungout passed by and every single time he wanted to have sex but I just wanted to play some video games with him or watch a movie but all he did was want to have sex and when I would say no he would keep asking me so I just did to make him stop because I knew he wouldnt unless I did and that continued for a little bit. But this one time I was really tired of him doing that and really sore from working out so couldnt fight back as much and I kept saying no but he wouldnt stop so to get it over with i just did and i had my face shoved into the pillow and was crying and when we stopped I went into the bathroom and just cried for a little. After that I think I overwhelmed my body a lot and got a really bad cold and a fever for 4 days and on one of those days my best friend tried to kill herself and ended up in the hospital and I couldnt cry at all and eventhough he new he broke up with me the day after because he liked another girl. For a long time I never rlly thought of it to be as rape and to this day it's kinda hard for me to process that I got raped(I'm not sure why but those words make me feel like I'm swallowing a bowling ball) and it just feels like it couldnt happen because he was my boyfriend but I said no many times and even if I didnt say it sternly. NO MEANS NO. I know I wont ever tell anyone who it is and most likely wont tell anyone else either than my best friend(she doesnt know the full story either) what happened because like I said it doesnt feel like it actually happened cuz all the stories you hear are so awful and it felt like nothing like that could happen to me but anything can. I just want any young girls reading this eventhough I am rlly young myself to know that love makes you blind and please dont ever feel pressured to do anything even if your friends are losing it doesnt mean you have to either and take it at your own pace and only do it when you feel ready. To anyone who's made it this far thank you and I hope you guys have a wonderful morning day or nightüíï
291,"I was watching switched at birth a couple years ago, when bay got raped, it made me realize an encounter I had had wasn't ok and that would have listen to my gut."
292,"My boyfriend is extremely supportive of me and knows of my past trauma, but I have not told his parents or mine. 

His mother has talked about how abortion is terrible and should never be allowed. She has said that sometimes God wants a woman to be raped and have a child, and that‚Äôs his plan. 

I don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs so hard for people to have empathy towards rape victims. It hits home for me. This conversation happened a month ago, and I left the table in tears and couldn‚Äôt talk about it again. Now, a month later, I still get panic attacks and get very angry about it. I get anxious every time before I see his family. 

What advice do you have for forgiving people that mean well / moving on from offensive comments? Do you ever bring it up again?"
293,"I‚Äôve never been traumatically sexually assaulted. More like endlessly groped, insulted, etc... especially in the halls of high school. 

Then my ex husband became an abusive drug addict and I left six months into it. Even though I‚Äôd  left him I wasn‚Äôt able to escape for three years because of a judge. 

He refused to grant me no contact when picking up and dropping off the kids. This was in large part due to his mom and a slimy lawyer. I had no lawyer. I had no money. 

I was in three years of hell. Most cops wouldn‚Äôt take me seriously because he kept testing clean. A cop he went to high school with let him dump some drugs on the side of the road so he‚Äôd get in less trouble after being arrested for hitting me. It was just a punch to the arm but he‚Äôd been at my house refusing to leave for three days and I was done. 

It wasn‚Äôt until he was finally arrested on weapons charges that I was allowed to leave the state with my kids after three years of 30 to 50 texts and calls daily. Trolling my house. Refusing to pick up and drop off the kids. Ripping the dash out of my car one night. Endless insanity. 

By that time I was broken. I‚Äôm still broken. Thankfully he‚Äôs sober and making amends and able to be there for his kids.  

This is why I‚Äôm so insanely upset over this hearing. I can‚Äôt stop crying and feel so crazy and upset.

So no I‚Äôve never been officially sexually assaulted but was systematically abused by the system set up to protect me. 

My ex got sober within six months of having his kids taken away. Keeping family‚Äôs together is not always the way to go.

I can forgive my kids dad because he‚Äôs gone above and beyond to make it up to me but I can never forgive our legal or law enforcement system. Ever.

If there‚Äôs a better place for this or a more appropriate hash tag let me know. 
I think it‚Äôs less about the specific type of incident and more about being utterly powerless at the hands of abusive men. "
294,"Voters in California have voted to recall the judge who consistently gave white male privileged sex offenders and domestic violence offenders ultra-light sentences, while imposing heavy sentences on POC for smaller nonviolent crimes like drug possession. 

Brock Turner raped an unconscious woman behind a dumpster and this judge felt that crime warranted 6 months in jail. Voters disagreed.

This recall is a victory for fans of justice everywhere!

295,"I (17m) was Sexually assaulted by a very close female friend of mine (18F). I viewed her as nothing but a close friend and never had any sexual intentions towards her. 

We planned to  eat some Chinese food and spend quality time together because we haven‚Äôt seen each other in a very long time. Once we finished eating she wanted to ‚Äútalk‚Äù so I agreed to only talk. But, she had other intentions and decided to reach inside my pants and grab my penis. I was in total disbelief and shook. How could she? 

Fast forward to a year later, I told very close friends of mine about the situation and one friend decide to tell one of her friends and she is now playing the victim, stating the opposite happened and I reached into her pants. Because she is a female, her story is more credible than mine and is acting the part of the victim, posting many SA items on her social media pages. As a result, I lost almost all my friends and am now labeled  the abuser. I am currently suing for defamation of character but I feel even this won‚Äôt clear the emptiness I currently feel. It hurts me extremely much and this is why many men go unheard and sorted as unbelievable."
296,"You know what's really fun, comforting your crying dog because it is scared of cars to realize a man is masturbating to you.

Right there in the streets of Paris, in a high-end neighborhood. A neighborhood you spend more than half your income to live in to feel safe. Your crying dog is not going to attack the guy and you have to cross his path to get him hoping it will not suddenly get sticky on the side of your favorite jacket.

While you walk past him with a ""Wtf"" look on your face, he locks eyes with you without flinching and keeps on going. 

The rest of the day you are thinking about this, how he didn't flinch, and how to thank goodness he didn't rape you there. Instead, he messes up your entire week, imposes a new fear, makes you feel unsafe, and creates mistrust in other men.

A similar instance when I was walking to a cafe with a few girlfriends. Some naked guy in a trench coat rollarscated by flashed us, his hard private showing, and just rollerbladed away."
297,"Last year, I stood by victims as I do now. I don‚Äôt care if the evidence is against the victim (usually a woman), I believe you. I support you.

I had my own investigation and of course he denied the claim against him. There‚Äôs a race position (I‚Äôm a minority. He‚Äôs white). There‚Äôs a power position (he‚Äôs my superior). There‚Äôs a gender difference. I would never go through this. I would never want someone to call me a liar. I‚Äôm standing up for the next girl. I hope my claim will be the start to bringing down his empire.

No matter what. I know you wouldn‚Äôt go through what you did. Receive comments like ‚Äúlies‚Äù and name calling. You‚Äôre strong for sharing what you can, but I‚Äôve been in the position when you wait because you‚Äôre scared.

Whoever you are. I BELIEVE YOU. I SUPPORT YOU."
298,"In the New Years of 2019 I got sexually assaulted after a night of heavy drinking ( of course given by my rapist ) it was at this model from IMG known as Ivanka. I am sick and tired of seeing her everywhere and people not knowing what she did to me. I was at her house for the new year she invited me, my ex best friend and her Ivanka‚Äôs ex and his friends. His friends were weird and very obsessed with sex it‚Äôs all they talked about.. the night of he made me drink ( her boyfriend best friend) a lot of champagne and they rolled me a pure joint all for myself naturally I blacked out. I don‚Äôt remember anything precise I just saw our conversation by text I assumed he told me to text him while I was blacked out to meet me in the smoking room. After that all I remember is glimpses of what happened thankfully he didn‚Äôt penetrate me as I was a virgin at the time but he did abuse of me while I was in no position to give consent. When I realized what happened I told my best friend at the time and she freaked out so naturally we told Ivanka. Her friends were already lying about me to cover up the assault making me seem like I was slut turning them on when I didn‚Äôt do anything of a sort. Ivanka when she found out about she still invited him to her birthday party saw me crying and did nothing. He came up to me and told me to finish what we started and that‚Äôs when I went into full panic mode. A few weeks later I receive messages from her telling me I‚Äôm lying about getting abused and that it‚Äôs ‚Äú easy ‚Äú to say I blacked out. I was baffled she had been a close friend for 3 years.. I didn‚Äôt understand. She kept defending my rapist so I decided to stop the friendship. She didn‚Äôt ever apologize to me, all she cared about was being friends with m‚Äôy ex best friend again and she told her that she felt bad about not believing me but never FUCKING TEXTED ME TO APOLOGIZE.. now this evil women is doing chanel catwalks, campaigns with Westwood, having articles written about her and she is a rape apologist. I don‚Äôt know why I wouldn‚Äôt speak up about this. Maybe because my only witness dumped me last year for no reason ( my ex best friend ) and became friends with Ivanka again with no respect for what Ivanka did to me and my conversation with her was on Snapchat so I have no longer the messages of her defending him and idk if that will make me seem like I‚Äôm lying, I‚Äôm not seeking revenge, I just don‚Äôt think awful women like this deserve to have a happy and successful public career after defending a rapist. Her friends rapist. He made me do things to him while I was blacked out that‚Äôs rape. It‚Äôs not my first time dealing with men that think they can control my body and she knew that. It‚Äôs been a few years and not one apology from her ? How is that ok ? How do I get to live with this trauma while she gets to be a public figure ? Is that really what we want a rape apologist succeeding without even feeling sorry for what she did to me ? I don‚Äôt know what to do. My best friend ditched me for her because she‚Äôs famous now it‚Äôs quite obvious. I‚Äôm depressed and feel betrayed and I want justice. I can‚Äôt go to court because it‚Äôs useless. But I wish that I can get justice for this, not allowing her to succeed even more after what an unforgivable act has been committed. As women we should stick together and they both betrayed me both Ivanka and Emma my ex best friend I am not afraid to speak up. And Ivanka if u ever read this fuck you for defending my rapist you piece of shit."
299,"I'm still confused about what happened to me in the past.... I was watching the movie ' The Perks Of Being A WildFlower' ( Spoilers for the movie/book) and I got to the part where Charlie rembered a repressed memory of his aunt molesting him and it suddenly made me remember a repressed memory of my older cousin grinding on me 

I was maybe around 5-7 I was playing with my two boy cousins one was a year younger than me and my other cousin ( his older brother) was 4 years older than him we were playing and I don't know how but somehow my older cousin was on top of me and grinding me, basically dry humping me I was squirming and trying to get him off of me but since he was bigger than me that didn't help my other cousin also tried to get him off of me but again he didn't move and just kept grinding on me I don't know if I ever did told him to actually stop I just remember squirming and fussing keep in mind he was about 4 years older than me and my other cousin so he'd be at least starting middle school 

Finally my mom walked in she said ‚Äù No, no, no ‚Äù and that's when my older cousin got off I don't remember the rest of what happened after that or before that all I really remember is him grinding him I didn't really know was sex was all I knew that it caused a funny, good feeling down there 

I don't see my cousins much anymore ( for unrelated purposes) But I still feel uneasy remembering the moment I cried the first time I rembered it me and my mom haven't spoken about it neither did me and my cousins and I'm afraid that if I do now it'll mess up the family

I just wanted to get this out there. I don't know if this really counts as a MeToo story since I feel like it isn't that serious ( I don't know how to word it exactly) Idk but it still kinda changes the way I see my older cousin now I used to look up to him He used to be my favorite but now not anymore"
300,"I don't even know where to begin so sorry if I ramble but this has been eating me up lately... I've had 3 bad experiences. They weren't rape but calling them sexual assault just sounds too... harsh. But I have been sexually assaulted. 3 times. The first time it didn't even hit me that it fucked me up until over a year later. The 2nd one CRUSHED me. The 3rd one didn't even register. I feel like I'm just used to it at this point. 

I don't feel like like I have a right to be this worked up about it. 3 separate assaults from 3 separate people. 2 boyfriends and 1 friend. I feel like I'm never going to be able to trust men again. I've just recently started being able to even let my dad hug me. I isolate myself and I just feel dead inside but I feel like it wasn't serious enough for me to feel this way. 

I try to talk to my therapist about it but it's so hard for me to get the words out. It's so hard for me to say out loud that I told my first boyfriend to stop because I wasn't wet enough and he didn't stop. It hurt and it made me bleed. But that one is somehow not even the worst one? The other two weren't physically as bad but they FUCKED ME UP emotionally. Probably because the assaults happened right after I told them about the previous ones. Like what made these guys think that I was interested in being romantic with them after I cried and told them I had been assaulted before?? WHAT THE FUCK?? 

I tried dating earlier this year and I couldn't stomach it. I broke up with him and I told him that I wasn't ready to date because I had been sexually assaulted before and I couldn't handle being vulnerable with anyone new. He said he understood but then he said he wanted one more kiss. I kissed him but every time I think about this I just get so ANGRY. He didn't *ask* if he could kiss me. He *told* me he wanted to kiss me. Dude, what the fuck is going on in your head that makes you think this is acceptable? 

WHY DID THIS HAVE TO HAPPEN TO ME?? WHY SO MANY TIMES???

I just want to get over this. Advice and words of encouragement are welcome."
301,"I am a 22 year old male. This event occurred when I was pretty young. I am not sure exactly how old, but I would say 4-6. I did not even remember that this happened until about 2 years ago, but once I remembered, I have been unable to forget it and I question how it has affected my life since. I remember my mom walking in and seeing my brother molest me, but I have no idea if she kept it to herself. What I do know is that is was never mentioned again afterwards. As much as I would like to think it doesn't affect me, I still feel as if it does affect me on a subconscious level because I have a really hard time being intimate or vulnerable with anyone. Do I bring this up with my family? I don't know what to do."
302,"Sorry if this breaks the rules. I just want people to remember this is happening.

As of now, the court date is July 12th. My bet is Ghislaine un-alives herself in some impossible way or another major story breaks that we all shift focus to. If they get to go through with the case she most likely won't implement anyone else in fear. If by some minuscule chance she spills the beans and throws people under the bus it'll be crazy."
303,"Hi everyone,

I'm a PhD researcher in Australia conducting interviews with women about their experience participating in the Me Too movement. I posted this ad about a month ago but I'm still looking for more participants. There will be no questions asking about your specific experiences of sexual harassment and assault, just questions about your participation with the Me Too movement.

I'd be so thankful if anyone here would be interested in being interviewed for my research.

If you are, please fill out the following form: [https://forms.gle/9qGvZMMvEouULsQv7](https://forms.gle/9qGvZMMvEouULsQv7)

Thank you!"
304,"I got my rapist expelled through title ix. It was really hard won, and I‚Äôm very proud of all my sacrifices that made it happen. He sued the school, sued me, etc. But it was all thrown out by judges. 

However, I‚Äôm worried about the future. We went to a very prestigious university and he was set to go to an even more well known law school. So in his mind, I ruined his life. I was the only one out of the five (I know about) to come forward and file a case because he specifically chose women with mental illness since it makes us more vulnerable. I know his type. He‚Äôs going to do everything he can to salvage his life (ie suing) but if that all fails, his anger and resentment towards me will grow until I‚Äôm sure it will become a rage filled obsession. Somehow, I just know that unless he suddenly finds religion or a lot of therapy, that‚Äôs how it will play out.

I‚Äôm worried about what he might do in the future if he continues to be unhappy and his life stays ‚Äúruined.‚Äù I‚Äôm afraid of more violence but there are lots of things he could do to hurt me.

Does anyone have experience with successfully punishing their rapist and then having them come after you later in life? This has been a real concern of mine for years."
305,"I have never told my story to anyone, but this night I finally told my dad. I got sexually assaulted when I was around the age of 5. And by the time I realised what had happened to me, I thought it was to late to tell anyone. My dad‚Äôs reaction was the worst that could happen. He was like asking ‚Äòthis happened like 10 years ago and you‚Äôre still upset about it?‚Äô. I went to my room and a few panic attacks and mental breakdowns later, he came to my room to apologise and he gave me a hug. I guess it could have been worse. In the end I am so happy to be able to talk about it."
306,"The #MeToo movement has a great reason and I applaud those who are participating in it. However, this movement has done the opposite of what it has done for many. This movement is a trigger. This movement brings up old wounds. This movement has brought me anxiety. This movement is bringing up depressive thoughts. 

I don't want to go into details of my rape, but it ruined my life for several months and years. It took time and counseling to get over my self hate and to finally get past this horrific event. I have moved on...I have a successful career, an amazing man, in graduate school, and on most days my depression/anxiety is under check. Now, 9 years later this #MeToo movement is here. I can't explain it well, but this movement has completely triggered terrible emotions and feelings. I don't want to feel forced to bring up old wounds. I don't want this pressure. I don't think about what happen to me. This is my choice. This is how I cope with what happened to me now. 

I want to tell people to careful with your words during this movement. To say people are too scared to post is not always true. Some people just don't want to share their stories on Facebook.  This is a very painful time for many people and it's just may be a trigger.

307,"I may communicate more about this under different flair, but for right now, I just need to share the fact that I've done it.

My own MeToo story has finally emerged, after decades of denial and buying into the story my extended family wove around the abuser and his behavior. Because of some intensive work I've been doing, health challenges that have forced even more introspection, and an eerie echo (someone who resembles the abuser engaging in a nearly identical behavior) that's allowing me to rewrite a childhood story for my adult self (with unparalleled support), I've decided to... well, to start a Thing, of the highly public ""art project"" flair variety. 

I've just hit send on an email and FB message to a select group of people in my world who I believe would want to know I'm doing it, and/or who might want to contribute in some manner. There's going to be a lot of work to do, though I've set key wheels in motion. And I've just put the most deeply personal part of my Self out there for them to see. I chose my recipients carefully... but I... am... scared... as... fuck.

Thanks for letting me get that out.  "
308,"I'm 24 and I've known for about a year that I was molested/raped as an infant (under one year till I was 2-4 it wasn't known for certain).

310,"Idk how to even talk about this but I need support. I went to a ‚Äúfriends‚Äù house on Tuesday evening. It was her, her fianc√©, and later on, one of her fianc√©s friends. We had like 2ish drinks and that‚Äôs all. I do smoke weed for my anxiety so when they pulled out the dab rig I was all in. I took one TINY hit and immediately got dizzy and sick. I tried to get to my car where I went completely limp in my body. I started going in and out with this weird kaleidoscope sensation. I remember them grabbing me, all of them, from my car and dragging me back inside. I kept coming in and out and thought I was dying... as I was fading in and out, I saw the fianc√©s friend naked on top of me. I couldn‚Äôt move or vocalize anything at all. Finally I blacked out completely. I woke up to this man laying next to me. I had a pounding headache that felt like knives stabbing into my head and I vomited several times. I was scared so I didn‚Äôt say anything. I realized that my panties were gone and my pants but my top had not been moved. I laid there until this monster left, scrambled to find my keys and sped home as quickly as possible. I‚Äôve spent every day in bed since. 

Today I finally got up and went to this going away thing for an old friend and sat there awkwardly and so disconnected. It was so miserable...like dreadful. I ended up leaving early and I‚Äôm back in bed. 

I feel so alone and broken. I had trust issues before this but the fact that a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù had a part in this is destroying my trust in everything I know. I really don‚Äôt know what to do or think or feel. 

I‚Äôm very aware that I should press charges but that‚Äôs kind of the least of my concern at the moment."
311,"My co worker sent me porn, beastiality porn, anti Semitic and animal cruelty videos.

The previous woman who worked with him resigned after she couldn‚Äôt take

This to people rather than just my family x"
312,"Edward Furlong was the child star who first got his fame in Terminator 2. Jacqueline Louise Domac was the on-set tutor for the child actors in T2. Edward was 14 at the time, and presumably the relationship started then. They dated for years and though they claimed not to ""do anything"" until he was legal, I have my doubts. They broke up with Jacqueline later suing and claiming Edward beat her (despite the fact that she had a conviction for disturbing the peace, which was later expunged). 

Edward ended up with a serious drug addiction and some pretty bad charges himself. Though I can't excuse what Edward did, I can't help but view this as a result of the abuse Jacqueline pushed onto him. 

The entire Hollywood scene knew about this - and nobody told him it was wrong. His family tried at one point but his family life was scattered and nothing came out of it. Edward was also misled by her and filed for emancipation. He later on claims that he regretted the relationship, wished he could push rewind on it, but nobody told him it was wrong at the time. 

To date, he's been in and out of jail and has done some bizarre things under the influence of drugs. Either way his life is ruined. There's articles that say he flipped out at her but I can't blame him - when you realize you've been groomed into sexual abuse under the guise that it's ""cool"" to date an older woman, and that you've been purposely kept away from girls your age, it's messed up. It messes with your brain. 

Eventually they went their ways and Jacqueline taught sex ed at a high school. Student reporters got word of her relationship with Edward and tried to publish an article about it in the student newspaper, but were barred by the principal and Domac's lawyer. They ended up publishing it in the LA Times. People still defended her and said she was a good person because she pushed for anti-junk food in schools.

 She now has a successful life and is living her life to the fullest - with a name change, to hide what she did. Meanwhile, Edward is presumably trying to pick up the pieces in his life.

I can't help but feel that this is fucked up. She gets to live a happy, fulfilling life. His life is ruined, likely due to the fact that she molested him. And she never got in trouble. And ended up teaching sex ed to kids at a high school, of all subjects.

To this day she has never gotten in trouble and it seems so goddamn unfair. Edward didn't have a great family life to begin with, so Hollywood was extra tough on him - and she just made it worse."
313,"I thought the next generation of boys we're raising could accept the challenge of being more respectful of women than the last one, and the one before that. That may be true, but they are trend followers, and you as a parent may be the only resistance to some of the behavior they encounter at school.
I had an interesting conversation with my high school freshman son about an issue that moved the needle on sexual assault in his school in the past week. Apparently, a small bra-unhooking competition broke out, at first among a few popular guys on girls who considered them friends, then it spread to unsuspecting girls sitting in front of those boys in class or even in the hallways. Picture random attacks by the offending dudes just aggressively sticking their hands up girls' backs, I guess. They got many innocent bystanders (an awful phrase because this was clear sexual assault on all of the girls involved, regardless of whether they were ""in"" on the ""joke"" at the beginning), and so many girls were walking around on high alert in case it happened to them. 
Well, thankfully the main perpetrators couldn't slink around doing it forever, and the dean of students called them in individually and let them know how goddamn disgusting it was. I'm not aware whether anyone got suspended (I hope so), but there was official discipline, apparently. But the damage is already done.
My son said incredulously called it ""drive-by harassment,"" but here's what he said in earnest when I asked him if he had learned anything. [Paraphrasing here] ""They saw it as no big deal, or an immature prank at worst. It potentially tarnished those guys' reputations forever. If someone was running around pantsing guys in public, they would get punched. If you invade people's personal space, the gloves come off.""
So be aware that even though, god willing, your son's head may be screwed on straight, the culture and friends that are influencing him may be telling him violating women's bodies is no big deal. It turns out your son's friends still may not realize the seriousness of something like putting their hand on a woman's bra. I wonder where they were in school on the day they learned ""keep your hands to yourself"" and what part of that did not get through to them. We may have made strides, but we have a long way to go."
314,I was raped a couple years ago and suffer from ptsd.  My attacker told everyone in my community other wise and now people think I‚Äôm a ‚Äú freak‚Äù. I suffer a lot already and now have to deal with these disgusting insults. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. Any suggestions ?
315,"CW: pedophilia 

When I (M) was 13 or 14, I was abused by a 19 year old girl at a church summer camp. I believed it was consensual at the time, but looking back 10 years later I realize how messed up it was. It never escalated to penetrative sex, but we kissed and sexted and did over-the-clothes hands stuff. 

Im 24 now. I‚Äôm in NC, where the SAFE act extended the statute of limitations on sexual abuse of minors to 10 years after turning 18 (it was previously 3 years after turning 18). For people whose ability to file a case had expired before the SAFE act was passed, we have until the end of 2021 to file a case. I‚Äôm not sure which group I‚Äôm in, but I have until at least the end of the year to file a case.

From some very brief research, My abuser‚Äôs actions would count as ‚ÄúTaking Indecent Liberties with Children (N.C. Gen. Stat. ¬ß 14-202.1)‚Äù since she was 19 and I was either 13 or 14 at the time. 

Should I take legal action? What are my options to do so? It was over ten years ago. There were text messages that could be used as evidence, but I don‚Äôt think I have my old phone with those messages on it. I didn‚Äôt tell many people about it, because the abuser was my friend‚Äôs older sister and I thought of it as like a secret accomplishment to ‚Äúget with‚Äù a girl so much older. 

I went on the RAINN chat and looked at their article on laws in the state. I don‚Äôt think there was any penetration, so it does not count as a ‚Äúsexual act‚Äù for felony purposes. I don‚Äôt remember, though. 

I don‚Äôt have the financial means to pursue serious legal action. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Any advice? And are there any other communities I should post this to?"

Please share this video so that people know the truth."
318,"Do you ever get that?
I was assaulted (nearly raped) by one of my best friends boyfriend. Just over a year ago. When it happened I was a few months away from being 18. I thought that if I spoke up about it our names would forever be attached. It didn't help when the kavanaugh hearings were all everyone was talking about. 

The guy who did it to me wants to go into the military and then do work as a public official before getting into politics. My heart sank because as I sat for weeks thinking about how I was the one who was going to ruin his life I had no idea how his actions were going to f*** with mine. 

This incident combined with my rocky mental health really turned my life upside-down. Everything was scary everyone was someone to question. Not to mention I still had classes with him, mutual friends with him (ugh that's a rant all on its own), I still had to see him everyday and see how completely unaffected he was.

I got to experience him deny everything that happened straight to my face. I got to see him cover up the scratches on his neck with a scarf that he got endless compliments on. I got to see our friends choose his side of the story. I got to see him go on with his life, keep dating my friend and many others.

I to this day don't know if I made the right choice or if I'm still making the right choice. I don't know if there is a ""right choice"". I have had people offer to beat him up, scare him, confront him, report him, get him arrested etc. And I'm not going to lie what I wouldve given to just give him one really good meaningful slap. But I didn't want that. I didn't want to treat violence with violence I didn't want to see him make the people around me lose their senses because they were angry and frustrated for me.

I thought that this would go away. I thought I could use this to evolve. I thought I could handle him acting like it never happened. ""Time heals all wounds"" right? I hate that here I am a year later still thinking about him and ya know what he's definitely not thinking about right now?

I just want him to admit to me that he did wrong. I want him to admit to himself that what he did was wrong. I want him to not be able to sleep with himself. I want him to just cry for me, cry for the friendship he lost. Cry for the pain he caused. Cry. I just want him to feel regret. I just want him to torture himself the same way I did the same way I have thinking what happened was somehow my fault.

The anger I feel is sometimes towards myself for ever taking on any blame. There's part of me that doesn't want that kind of anger to be directed any anyone but there's just this little part of me that wants to see him suffer. Not physically, I just want to know that of the two of us I'm not the only one that walked away hating myself. 

I just don't want to feel alone anymore."
319,"Ok, so something happened yesterday and I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm overreacting or not. So my ex who sexually assaulted me last May is in most of my classes since we‚Äôre both majoring in chemical engineering and we‚Äôll be in most of the same classes until we both graduate. And one of the classes we have together, Fluid Dynamics, has a lab. And the first day of classes this semester the professor told us that he would be splitting the class into lab sections alphabetically. And I got nervous because my ex‚Äôs last name starts with F and mine starts with H, and that‚Äôs pretty close alphabetically. So I emailed the professor and asked if we could be in different lab sections because I feel uncomfortable around him and I threw in a ‚ÄúTitle IX‚Äù just so he would know that it was actually serious. And he agreed and told me to let him know immediately about any issue. So I was glad about that. And then yesterday I had lab, and at the beginning the professor was talking to the group about what would be happening in the lab and logistical stuff. And then once he finished he went ‚Äúwhat are you doing here.‚Äù And I heard my ex‚Äôs voice behind me say ‚Äúyeah, I‚Äôm here to take pictures for my lab report.‚Äù And I turned around and my ex was right behind me. And when I say right behind me I do mean right behind me. And I was shocked. And my professor said ‚Äúno. Come back another time.‚Äù Which I was really really glad about. And I didn‚Äôt have time to think about it during lab, but after lab ended I was really freaked out by it. Because the whole class has access to a list saying who‚Äôs in which lab section, so he would have known I was in this section not only from that but also from the whole alphabetical thing. And also he could have stood anywhere else in the room but he chose to stand right behind me. And I was shaking really bad after the lab ended and I couldn‚Äôt stop. And I don‚Äôt know if he was trying to intimidate me or what. But it really scared me and I‚Äôm worried he‚Äôll try something else to try to intimidate me. I‚Äôm gonna call my mom tomorrow to ask her what I should do. Because I don‚Äôt want to go back to Title IX because they already screwed me over to try to cover their own butts and basically let him go free with only a chat about appropriate behavior even though I wasn‚Äôt the only one who reported him within the one year he‚Äôd been at college. And I don‚Äôt want to have a whole thing this semester because last semester was hard enough. I just need some support and advice for how to get through this."
320,"To clarify, my dad and I don‚Äôt have a good relationship and have been going to counseling for 4+ years. I posted about my sexual assault story about 3 months ago on this sub, and I don‚Äôt know how to link the original post to this post so if you want to find it, the title is ‚ÄúSexually assaulted by summer camp counselor‚Äù anyway, Today I had a meeting with my prosecution team and the probation officer that will be overseeing my abuser (predator). When the discussion was coming towards an end, my dad blatantly said, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt take this the wrong way, but I think that *predator* has it worse than you do‚Äù. Here‚Äôs why this pisses me off... I went through hell for 2 years. Year 1, I met the predator and he physically assaulted me meanwhile I had an eating disorder and family problems and my predator took advantage of that. He would ask me to do vile things and send him nasty images/videos. He then told me he‚Äôd kill or hurt himself if I didn‚Äôt do it. I was 15. Year 2, I came forward with my story and when it came out in the paper, I lost all my friends. I sit alone at lunch every day and get judged by bitches. Everyone thinks I‚Äôm some slut who lets guys finger me until I bleed and flirt with 20 year old Men. Which is completely false. I didn‚Äôt want that abuse. Im still healing from it. Anyway, I‚Äôve had to relive it all every day because of the law system and how slow the process is. Meanwhile, my dad is over here exclaiming how my experience was not close to as bad as my predators life is now. If my predator has it worse off, he wouldn‚Äôt have groomed, assaulted, and continuously harassed a 15 year old. But anyway, thanks dad."
321,"I‚Äôm sorry if this is the wrong sub for this. You will find the post describing what happened on my account page. (I‚Äôm on mobile and don‚Äôt know how to link it)

So basically when I was 10, (about two/three years ago) my cousins sexually assaulted me and tried to rape me and I only a few months back have realized what he did, now I don‚Äôt know how to tell my parents.

The only person I told was my sister, who my cousin molested twice. She haven‚Äôt spoken about it and when I asked her to come forward with me to our parents she brushed me off saying that she didn‚Äôt want to and that she was too ashamed, which by all means I respect in a way. I want to tell my oldest cousin, who I trust a lot even though we don‚Äôt see each other‚Äôs very often, but I don‚Äôt know if he would believe me and/or if he would do anything.

So right now I‚Äôm alone, and hurting even though I hide it really well. I keep trying to move forward and be my very best but it feels like I will never achieve my goals and ambitions because of what he did, like there‚Äôs a weight that pulls me ever so slightly back every time. Any help on how to tell my parents would be really appreciated. 

And to you M. Go to hell."
322,"I wrote this to post to FB and tag all the named abusers, but I want to post it here anonymously to see the kinds of responses I should expect before I do.

Viewer discretion advised.

I wrote this paper during the Brett Kavanaugh hearing this last fall, but was talked out of posting it. However, I firmly believe that sexual assault and harassment take place everyday throughout America and it isn‚Äôt being addressed. In an attempt to live boldly, I have decided to bare my soul and share with you my deep shame of a few of my own sexual assault stories in an attempt to encourage deep thought and discussion on what constitutes sexual assault and how it should be addressed. I hope that through my own vulnerability I can encourage others to join me in speaking about this uncomfortable topic openly so that someday we will see those who touch others without their permission held accountable for their actions.

I feel like I have been taught from a young age that I am nothing more than a sexual exploit. I have always been told that I radiate sexual energy and that I am flirting with everyone. I can recall a time in the 4th grade where a male classmate and I would walk around the field at recess together talking about video games. One day, a girl in my class asked me if I liked him because I was always flirting with him. I asked her what flirting was and she responded that it‚Äôs when you twirl your hair. I told her I didn‚Äôt remember twirling my hair and she told me I was missing the point. She told me I must like him because something about the way I chose to talk to people clearly insinuated sexual longing. I didn‚Äôt know what sex was. I was 9.

When I got to middle school, things got worse. Several times in 8th grade, I would receive anonymous phone calls from boys sexualizing my body and talking about my boobs. I had my mother listen to one of the voicemails. She was disgusted. I didn‚Äôt understand. I remember one day hearing the rumor that one of my 8th grade classmates had said he would fuck me if he could put a bag on my head because I had a nice body, but an ugly face. I was 13 and knew that sex led to babies, but didn‚Äôt yet grasp the erotic, sexual implications of his statement. I was just upset he had called me ugly. I remember the day one of my classmates came up to me in the cafeteria, looked at my chest, said ‚Äúit is true,‚Äù and walked away. It was circulating that I had uneven boobs. I remember being in band class and being asked if I would give Ely a blowjob. I asked what it was and was told it was like a blow pop. I said sure and they all laughed. I didn‚Äôt get it. These were the years when I started being called a slut.

As I entered high school, I became more curious about what sex was. According to everyone I was having a lot of it, so I figured I should at least know what it is. I used to talk about it a lot. Ask people questions. Try to understand what it was, why people were doing it, whether or not it was enjoyable. I can‚Äôt even remember all the things I asked. I guess this is why I continued to be called a slut. I talked about sex a lot. I started to be told that boys were only being nice to me because they wanted to have sex with me. These are the years when I really started to internalize that who I was did not matter. I would always be just a sexual exploit for men.

When I got to college, so many people touched my body without permission. I guess I was just giving off more of that undeniable sexual energy that even 9 year old me emanated. I remember crying a lot and writing in my diary asking myself why men didn‚Äôt see me as anything else. Wasn‚Äôt I smart? Wasn‚Äôt I funny? Wasn‚Äôt I nice? Didn‚Äôt people want to get to know me? Time and time again, I was slapped in the face with a resounding ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù People didn‚Äôt want to get to know me. Why would they? I was just a vagina to them.

I am so ashamed to admit to all of you some of the sexual assault that I have experienced because I blame myself. How could I not? I‚Äôve been told since I was 9 that I am the one giving everyone the notion that I want to have sex with them. When I run through each assault, I think of all the reasons why it was my fault. But, I want to start healing and so I pose the question to you and myself, was it my fault?

In 7th grade, almost every day I would come to school and Rudy would grope my boobs. I would be in math class and he would come up behind me, pull me to his chest, and squeeze them both tight. I asked him to stop. I tried to avoid him, but we had classes together and he would do it when I was walking to turn in my homework. He would do it when I was walking to get in line in the cafeteria. He would find me when I didn‚Äôt even know he was anywhere nearby and touch my chest unapologetically, claiming that he had the right because they should be enjoyed. I was 12. Sometimes it would hurt, but most times it just made me feel like I had no ability to keep men away from my own body. I told my friends about it. I know the other students saw it happen. But I never told any adults. I didn‚Äôt tell any teachers. I didn‚Äôt tell my parents. Why didn‚Äôt I tell anyone? Why didn‚Äôt I ask for help when my pleas for him to stop made no difference? If I really wanted it to end, couldn‚Äôt I have done more? Was it my fault?

At the end of high school, I was getting a ride home from a friend after powder-puff practice. We were in a truck and Michael was sitting between the driver and myself. While we were driving, Michael put his hand under my shirt and started feeling his way under my bra. I froze. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I couldn‚Äôt believe that the driver didn‚Äôt notice. For the whole drive to my home, Michael held a conversation with the driver while groping me. I sat in silence and thanked God that I lived only 10 minutes form campus. But why didn‚Äôt I just tell him to stop? Why didn‚Äôt I call him out? Why didn‚Äôt I do anything? Why did I just sit there and wish he would leave me alone? If I really wanted it to end, couldn‚Äôt I have done more? Was it my fault?

The summer after I graduated high school, I wanted to go see a friend of mine perform in Austin. He was in a band and I had always had a soft spot for him. I had wrecked my car earlier that summer and didn‚Äôt have any way to get to Austin, so a mutual friend of ours, Ely, gave me a ride. He had insinuated that I could make it up to him later. I shouldn‚Äôt have gone. Instead when he dropped me off, he told me that I owed him a boob groping. He had given me a ride and felt he deserved something in return. Why didn‚Äôt I just say no and get out of the car? I didn‚Äôt want to do it, but I owed him, right? Why did I not realize that I didn‚Äôt owe him? That nobody has a right to tell me they get touch my body if I don‚Äôt want them to? Why didn‚Äôt I just walk away? Why did I just close my eyes and let him do it? If I really didn‚Äôt want it to happen, couldn‚Äôt I have done more? Was it my fault?

My whole freshman year of undergrad I was always getting sick, so I would make jokes that North Carolina and I didn‚Äôt get along. I was prescribed antibiotics and warned not to drink alcohol while taking them, but I didn‚Äôt listen. It was the night of the Kappa Sig/Sig Ep annual ‚ÄúCall on Me‚Äù party and I had friends in both fraternities, so I went to the Sig Ep pregame and the Kappa Sig pregame before making my way to the Barn. I drank a lot. I was drunk and out of it, a side effect of the antibiotics and alcohol. I had given a friend my antibiotics to hold in her purse and I set a timer on my phone to take them at midnight. I remember having to pee a lot. I was constantly running to the bathroom and there was always a line. I had very little bladder control and even with squeezing it in as hard as I could, I still soaked my panties. When my alarm went off, I went to find my friend. Instead I ran into some guy I had met earlier that night. He was a student at UCSB visiting his friend in Sig Ep. I told him I was looking for my friend and we walked around the party, but couldn‚Äôt find her. He told me we should leave. I was tired and drunk and agreed that we should leave. We started walking, but I was really unsteady on my feet and he was half carrying me. There was a curb on the way to wherever he was taking me and I stopped and sat down. I remember telling him I just wanted to go to bed. He picked me up off the ground and said we were almost there. We weren‚Äôt almost there. He helped me walk all the way to an unfamiliar dorm. I remember telling him repeatedly that we couldn‚Äôt have sex. I was a virgin, but I didn‚Äôt tell him that. When we got to the dorm, I went to the bathroom and peed a little bit more into my panties trying to get them off fast enough but not succeeding. When I went into the room, he started undressing me. He asked me if I had peed myself. And I was so embarrassed that I lied. I told him I was just wet for him. Why did I lie? Why didn‚Äôt I just say yes, I‚Äôm a mess and I peed myself? Why didn‚Äôt I just leave? He took my unconvincing lie as permission to take his clothes off and start raping me. Hadn‚Äôt I told him we couldn‚Äôt have sex? I remember thinking when he stuck his penis into me against my wishes that it didn‚Äôt matter anymore. Holding onto my virginity had been for nothing and I just did whatever he said in silence. He was demanding. Turn over, turn over, put it in your mouth, doggy, missionary, top, bottom, put it back in your mouth. Over and over. And then I fell asleep. I woke up in the middle of the night, grabbed my things, and left. I was lost in the building and when I finally made it out, I was lost on campus. Where had he taken me? I remember the next morning recounting the story to my friends and them telling me I had been sexually assaulted. That was the first time in my life that someone told me that the way men were touching my body against my will wasn‚Äôt okay. They told me that I hadn‚Äôt been asking for it. Someone had to tell me that. I remember thinking the next morning that if you had a lineup of men, I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to pick my rapist out of the lineup. He will be the only one I can‚Äôt call out by name because I don‚Äôt know who he is. I was so out of it, I had no idea what he looked like. I was told he had blue eyes. That‚Äôs all I know about the man who took my virginity. He had blue eyes and attended UCSB. How did this happen? Why didn‚Äôt I listen to the doctor‚Äôs warning? Why did I mix the alcohol and the antibiotics? Why did I go with him when he told me we should leave? Why did I tell him I was wet for him? Why did I not stop him when he started raping me? Why did I just lie there and let him do whatever he wanted? What is wrong with me? If I really wanted it to end, couldn‚Äôt I have done more? Was it my fault?

Another moment in my freshman year of undergrad, I was sitting in Nick‚Äôs room. There was a whole group of us in there watching some horrible movie called Get the Gringo. All of the seats were taken, so I joined Nick on the top bunk. He put his hands between my legs and asked me if I wanted him to finger me. I said no. He put his fingers in anyway and said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna tell me you don‚Äôt want this?‚Äù I said yes, I don‚Äôt want this. At that moment, someone called his name and he got up and left the room. After my rape, I thought maybe I just hadn‚Äôt been forceful enough with my words. This time I had tried to be more confident when I said no. I thought my words would mean more. I thought saying no would have been enough. But when it wasn‚Äôt, why didn‚Äôt I just get up and leave? There were so many people in the room, why didn‚Äôt I just yell ‚ÄúNick, get your fingers out of me. I said no!‚Äù? Why didn‚Äôt I do anything but just answer his questions when he asked? Why didn‚Äôt I do something? If I really didn‚Äôt want it to happen, couldn‚Äôt I have done more? Was it my fault?

You would think at this point that I would have realized the inadequacy of my words, but unfortunately I have one more tale to share. It was New Year‚Äôs Eve my freshman year of undergrad. The New Year was about to start and my new year‚Äôs resolution was to be more steadfast in my no‚Äôs. A friend of mine was pretty drunk and I had been drinking, so after we put her to sleep on the couch, I joined the host in his bed. I had always had a little crush on Jaxson. When I laid next to him in bed, he kissed me. It was sweet, but it was also late and I wanted to go to bed. He kept trying to convince me to sleep with him, but I was definitive and I kept saying no. He started telling me stories of how he had always loved me. He told me I was beautiful. He tried to put his fingers inside and I pushed them away. I said no. He finally let it go and I went to sleep. I had done it! And then he woke me back up and he started at it again, but this time he got on top of me. I just wanted to go to sleep. I was tired of fighting him. So, he raped me and when he was done, I grabbed my things and woke up my friend and drove us home. The whole drive home, I loathed myself. It was January 1st and I had already failed my New Year‚Äôs Resolution. I should have just walked away. Why didn‚Äôt I? Why did I get in his bed to begin with? Why hadn‚Äôt I continued to say no? Why did I let him wear me down? Why did I think my words were going to stop him in the first place? Why didn‚Äôt I just go home when the party ended? If I really didn‚Äôt want it to happen, couldn‚Äôt I have done more? Was it my fault?

Maybe everyone was right. Maybe I had always been a slut. Maybe I really was radiating sexual energy. Maybe it really is my fault. After the Jaxson rape, I had lots of sex. I think I was trying to normalize it and convince myself that it didn‚Äôt matter to me; that it wasn‚Äôt something I had always imagined would be a beautiful, intimate thing that I would cherish. I remember in college being so unhappy because all of those horrible things that kids had been saying to me my whole life were true. I was a slut. All of those sexual encounters I had, whether I wanted them or not, they were my fault. My fault.

So again, I ask you, were all of these my fault? I feel so responsible. Could I not have done more? When words failed me, why wasn‚Äôt I more physically aggressive? Why did I not stand up for myself? I didn‚Äôt ask to be sexually assaulted and yet I didn‚Äôt do enough to keep it from happening. So, that‚Äôs on me, right?

For all of you out there who are trying to pretend sexual assault isn‚Äôt plaguing humanity, think again. Sexual assaults happen everyday by people you know to people you know. And to all the other survivors of sexual assault, you‚Äôre not alone, #metoo."
323,"This is a throwaway account, in part because of some of the details, and in part because I don't feel my voice should overstep other voices.   


I was in the US Army Infantry. I was young, only 21. I'm a bisexual white male. It was 2008 the first time, and 2009 the second.   


Both times, the narrative would have been as believable and palatable as any apologist could ask for.   


White, male. Infantry, a man's man (although being bisexual would have cut into that, but they still couldn't have questioned it too much.) Neither time made it past an attempt, because being young, fit, and in training, I was too dangerous for that. And what conservative doesn't like the narrative of people in the LGBTQ community being predatory? Of course, this is only two interactions out of thousands, but they'd still lap it up. Too bad I could never tell.  


The first time, a friend's boyfriend came onto me, kind of strong. I'd never met him before, we're all at the club, he was shitfaced, I was fairly drunk, but still in control of my faculties. I remember roughly who was at the club that night, but not specifically. I don't remember which of my friends from my unit were there, if any, or if I was just out with my civilian friends. I couldn't tell you the time of year at this point, it's been fucking forever.   


Anyways, he decided he wanted a threesome, I don't remember if he knew I'd slept with his girlfriend or just decided I looked appetizing. I said no. That was around the time he grabbed me, tried to pull me in and kiss me. In public, in a military town, while I was military. I nearly broke his wrist stopping that advance, and explained in no uncertain terms if he tried to force himself on me again, I'd break every bone in his body. He wouldn't even look at me the rest of the night, although I avoided him after that.   


The second time, I was at a party. It was a convention, a hotel, and I was in a safe space, with people I was actually out to. I was drinking, having a great time. I wasn't under constant pressure not to be myself. And then a guy followed me into the bathroom, and went to grab me. I shoved him off, told him hell no. It was barely assaulty, but it was wildly inappropriate. He thought, just because I was bisexual and out to him, it meant I wanted to fuck. I didn't. I got called a cocktease by several people before giving up on the party.   


See, here's the thing. I'm a ""perfect victim"". I can't imagine any rape apologist seeing any problems in these stories at all. And yet, I never did report either of these attempts to anyone. Don't ask don't tell was still a thing, and the toxic masculinity would have had me guilty by association (ignore the fact that I'm actually bisexual, that's DADT for you, it's supposed to be as long as nobody knows, you're good). But I would have been out of the Army without any benefits in record time.   


I can tell you some of the details. Both times I was drinking but not drunk. One of the times, I'd dressed kinda slutty, to be totally fair, but that was for me. Neither made it past an attempt. And reporting would have destroyed my life.   


If I couldn't report, where the hell do people get off questioning anyone else who doesn't?   


This is the world we live in. This is rape culture and toxic masculinity. This is my story, and none of you are alone. "
324,"My grandfather had been my father figure my whole life. My mom and I moved in with my grandparents when I was three years old, and we lived there until I started high school. When we lived there, he drank excessively (he‚Äôs a recovering alcoholic) and would throw things or yell if he came home and the house wasn‚Äôt cleaned to his standard. He never touched me though. He‚Äôs very successful in his career path and has come up from being poor to being very wealthy. He is respected by many.

Fast forward to 30-year-old me. I had just separated from my then-husband and was finally free from that abusive and manipulative relationship. I decided I wanted to come out to my family, mainly because I didn‚Äôt want them to be surprised if I started dating a woman (I‚Äôm bi). Well apparently my grandfather took this some fucked-up-kind-of-way and decided to try and pull my strapless dress down one evening. He then hugged me close and tried to put his tongue in my mouth. I have never felt so disgusted and disgusting at the same time. I was staying at my grandparents‚Äô house since I was in town visiting for a week, so I hurried upstairs and locked myself in the bedroom. 

I told my grandma what had happened and she told me ‚Äúwell you shouldn‚Äôt have told him that you‚Äôre bisexual, now he sees you as a sexual object.‚Äù I told my mom, and she ‚Äúforgot‚Äù until I reminded her a few months ago when she was guilt tripping me about why I don‚Äôt want to talk to him on the phone or visit. She hasn‚Äôt talked about it or brought it up since.

I just feel really....confused. Violated. Uncomfortable. Shitty. If any of my children ever come to me with something, ANYTHING, I could never forget or leave them in the wind. I‚Äôd do whatever I could to show that I‚Äôm on their side and that they did nothing wrong. 

This isn‚Äôt my first time being sexually assaulted or harassed, but it‚Äôs the one time that fucks with me the most.

Edit: grammar"
325,"8 months later I finally reported the person who assaulted me to the police. Aside from COVID, I was hesitant at first because I was unsure, lack of evidence and whether a person would believe me. The only thing was telling my own story detail accounts of what happened. 

He was a graduate student at an Ivy League school. It happened on campus when we were alone and we were drinking. I was too drunk to drive home so I wanted to sober up. He suggested a movie. We kissed. I remember laying there. Then he started to get agressive and taking off my clothes. I was too intoxicated to move and I felt like I froze. I started to say ‚Äúno, not interested.‚Äù He had taken off his own clothes and started touching me everywhere. I kept saying ‚Äúno‚Äù then he said ‚Äúif you‚Äôre not ready, we can do it next week.‚Äù But I felt he kept touching me. I got scared he was going to go further and put it inside of me. I knew I was too intoxicated to fight him off. So I had to think of something to turn him off. So then I told him I had HPV because most men do not know what that is. 

Then he paused, he started telling me how his mom has it in the past and how it caused problems in their family. Then I noticed a change of tone in the room. In his eyes, I was no longer any value to him. He tossed me my clothes and kicked me out of the room and closed the door behind him. We never talked since. 

Ever since then I thought the feelings and the memories would go away and I would be able to move on. But the memories of the event would loop in my head and I would wake up crying in sweat. For the first time since I reported him I feel I can get closure in my life and start moving on and living my life."
326,"Next week I have an appt to formally report my abuser.  A lawyer has gotten ahold of me, we have been playing phone tag but it sounds like she may want to help me for free, which I really need, I am in no way rich and this guy is already trying to come at me for defamation because he is a very well known person. I am scared I will lose and turn around and be sued. I don't even know what too expect. An hours long interrogation? I am nervous and thought about saying fuck it. But i'm not going to. all of the legal aid offices arent taking me seriously i think because they only offer free consultations. I am hoping this lawyer is legit. I dont know what I am really trying to get at here, just the day is coming up so I guess im venting."
327,"I was ""dating"" this guy. I was 11 and he was 19 I thought I was super cool because an older guy asked me out and liked me. He was always trying to be... Sexual. I said I didn't want to do anything but I'd spend the night at his house and just sleep there with him sometimes. I'd wake up to him with his hands or mouth on my boobs multiple times and he convinced me that it was fine because we were dating. Some how I believed that. And once night be brought a bunch of pot and booze, I got strunk. And woke up to me having sex with me while I was asleep. It hurt and woke me up and I was freaking out and he held me down and finished. I broke up with him and he somehow still convinced me to not tell anyone and not tell cops. I didn't even know why but I knew it was wrong."
328,"Ok so this singer Callmekarizma has 30+ allegations against him. I know some of the alleged victims and have talked to them.(the singer is from Minnesota which is public knowledge so here is an article about him.)  Also I talked to someone who is an attorney and they said I could talk about this because it's not a official cease and desist meaning they don't send official cease and desists to your twitter account(I got one in dm) [https://www.musicinminnesota.com/minneapolis-artist-call-me-karizma-issues-cease-desist-letters-stemming-from-sexual-assault-allegations/](https://www.musicinminnesota.com/minneapolis-artist-call-me-karizma-issues-cease-desist-letters-stemming-from-sexual-assault-allegations/)

He has also sent inappropriate pictures to minors (they said they were)without consent which can be proven and released someones nudes also in a private chat. (can be proven) issue is nobody has talked to police as far as I know. Not sure what to do because as far as 2018 (allegedly) this has still been going on because I talked to someone who told me that. and it still could be going on today but I have no proof.

So I don't know what to do Police wouldnt do anything probably because I was not a victim myself (just a friend of the victims) and I did try and contact other people but nothing came of it.  Feel odd contacting the FBI  which someone suggested because now that I think about it I don't know if its a good idea. I think they should be able to decide if they want to contact authorities(the only reason i contacted police was because I was annoyed nothing really had been done other than warning people about him. (his last tour got cancelled because people were contacting venues) but now he is starting to do concerts again. What more can be done?

Also him or someone close to him found a friends phone number and texted them. I find this very creepy and I have known this person for a while and trust them. My friend has never texted callmekarizma before but he had tweeted about him. (proof that callmekarizma texted them [https://twitter.com/thewildoreo/status/1201709253389623296](https://twitter.com/thewildoreo/status/1201709253389623296) ) Also the phone number (seen in the video) is public knowledge too because Callmekarizma has tweeted it himself it's one he uses to keep in contact with fans and send them stuff about concerts or other stuff. (my friend said I could post about this in the past so I'm sure its fine)

Anyway I tried not to post a ton of links because that is not what the point of this thread is about. I'm wondering what else I can do. I don't want this guy possibly hurting someone else"
329,"Hi, so first off, #MeToo... about ten times over. Whether it be teachers, bosses, friends, lovers, I‚Äôve dealt with a lot of shit. I used to brush it off and not weigh my options.

That changed...I have changed. Through the influence of the strength of the other survivors around me, through the support and the love and understanding of my true friends and amazing husband I decided that this shit should not and will not happen to me anymore, not without consequences for the abuser.

I, along with most of the other women in my office, have been constantly sexually harassed by my boss. So I reported it to my manager, who laughed at me and told me all the fucked up shit my boss has done to other women. So I got a lawyer. And now I‚Äôm suing my boss for sexual harassment. It‚Äôs a lot. I have great lawyers, and a fantastic community but I still feel vulnerable and in some ways unsupported. It‚Äôs a really tough spot to be put in.

I have to go back to work on Monday and face him and all of my coworkers. This will be the first time I will be seeing them since the claim was filed. Everybody knows. Somebody showed everybody in the office the report. People are angry or upset or embarrassed...It‚Äôs gonna be rough.

I really do not feel prepared to face him or my manager or my coworkers. I really feel ill prepared for all of this. 

I‚Äôve been looking for resources and there really aren‚Äôt any that I could find for my situation. If anybody is going through similar stuff, my heart is with you and if you wanna connect for moral support just message me.

Let‚Äôs end the stigma of asking for help. Let‚Äôs end the stigma of being ashamed of being an ‚Äòaccuser‚Äô. We have nothing to be ashamed of. We have done nothing wrong. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
330,"TRIGGER WARNING: SEXUAL ABUSE 
So it‚Äôs been a long journey to get here but my brother sexually abused me when I was younger. I later found out that he had abused other family members as well. After that, I found out that my dad had abused my sister and her friend when she was younger. My step dad that I currently lived with also sexually abused me once and I still have to be around him every day. I‚Äôve told my mom about it multiple times but she clearly doesn‚Äôt respect me as a human or any of my emotions. I feel very isolated. One time my life long friends was asking about my brother as if she wanted to date him and it made me want to jump off a bridge. I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôve told her exactly what he‚Äôs done to me and others I know of. Either way, I don‚Äôt really have a family now. And when people ask me about my family I want to disappear from the conversation because nothing about mine is good. My family is a disgusting group of sexual abusers and it‚Äôs so fucked up and disgusting. Literally like every person in my family has experienced some sort of sexual trauma. I don‚Äôt talk to my dad at all after finding out what he did. He got me a truck before I turned 18. I took the truck from him, got the title to it, and then told him how I felt and that I can‚Äôt be around him anymore. He‚Äôs an alcoholic, and all he‚Äôs ever been in my life is a toxic force that I wanted to escape from. But now that I have, I feel guilty even though I shouldn‚Äôt. Especially about taking the truck, even though it was meant to be a gift in the first place. If anyone else had a dysfunctional family like mine, especially one rooted in sexual abuse, I‚Äôd love to hear your story cause I feel truly alone right now. It makes me upset because I feel all the shame, guilt, disgust, and burden, that should be being felt by the sexual abusers in my family, not me. But because I‚Äôm a part of it, it feels like the blame is partially on me. Which is exactly how I felt the first time I was sexually abused."
331,"It happened in a relationship in 2017 and more minor incidents continued through to 2019 where we broke up. While I have gotten better in regards to it, I had never gone to the police about it until today.
It was spontanious, but I've been thinking about reporting it for a long time now. I have chosen not to pursue action, but rather leave a report attached to his name so if anyone were to be assaulted by him and wish to go to court, she may have a better chance. It was hard and while I felt good walking in, as soon as I tried to tell them what it was about, I couldn't talk through my tears, but they were great. They got a female officer, took me into a room and let me speak about as much or little as I wished. Now, just a couple hours later, I feel so relieved and like I've taken another step in moving past this.

If anyone reads this who has had similar issues, I hope that you can feel safe enough to report it. While I don't want it to be at the expense of the victim's wellbeing, I believe it's important these things are talked about and expressed. Please, when you feel ready, go report it."
332,"Hello all,


We'd like to take a minute to remind any lurkers and all subscribers about a few things:


*The purpose of this subreddit is to bring to attention to the wide range of sexual violence and unwanted sexual experiences - regardless of gender, age, race, wealth, social, political, or legal status. By educating and supporting people through these traumas, we hope to help overcome the stigmas of sexual violence against all people.* 


*When ""MeToo"" is conflated or confused with some kind of feminine dominance it is harmful.  When it is equated with only being something faced by one gender, one culture, one political affiliation, it is incredibly harmful.* 

*MeToo is not confined to a woman or man.*  
*MeToo is about regaining the part of oneself that is taken without permission when being dominated by a person - a person who takes advantage of the vulnerable.*  
*It's about healing, coping, and surviving. If justice can be apart of that, all the better.* 

*This isn't about dividing, it's about uniting.*

333,"I was 19, you were 20. We had been dating for two weeks. That night we decided to go to a friend‚Äôs Halloween party. They had drinks. Liquors. Jell-O shots. Infused fruits. I drank too much, I‚Äôll admit it. That day was the first and only day I blacked out from drinking too much. I remember that night in fragments. I was sitting outside by the bonfire. Blackout. I got up to pour myself another drink and went outside. Blackout. I was sitting on the front lawn with a friend and laughing. Blackout. I was in your car kissing you, and I liked it. Blackout. My pants were by my ankles and I felt you trying to penetrate me as I moaned stop, no stop. Blackout. I shortly snapped out of these blackouts and told you firmly to stop and pulled my pants up and take me home. I went inside my parents house. Lights were off and everyone was asleep. I felt ashamed and disgusting. I had previously told  you that I was a virgin and waiting for the right person. You told me you admired that. The next day when we spoke about that night you claimed I asked for it. When I told you I blacked out you became defensive, you told me we were all drinking and there was no way of knowing I was too far gone. I knew you had some drinks but you were always modest with alcohol, and you drove me home that night. I told you I remember waking up to hearing myself telling you to stop. You tell me it‚Äôs not like we had sex, your penis couldn‚Äôt fit in anyway... I don‚Äôt know why I continued to date you. I don‚Äôt know why I married you. I guess I told myself you were a nice guy. You were hard working and honest. My parents liked you. They invited you over for dinner. I spent 5 years of my life with a man who sexually assaulted me and pushed this memory out of existence. I sit here in my car. A year after officially being divorced from you. Trying to face myself."
334,"when I was fifteen years old, I was raped repeatedly by my boyfriend who was 18. He always prided himself in not being physically abusive, yet would scream at me every few days about things I couldn't control. If we were at separate places, he would call me in the middle of the night and text me that I better answer even though I was sleeping. Made me feel guilty for every little thing I did. He would break my phone that I gave him to use just because I made him mad. When my family member died, he made everything about him and constantly argued with me. (Thankfully I left him shortly after this, as safely as I could)  When I was intoxicated, he would rape me when I would be blackout drunk at night. The only reason I remember the numerous amounts of times he raped me was because I would only be conscious for a few seconds-- then darkness. I have tried so hard for the past three years to suppress these memories-- telling myself that he was my boyfriend, I have to make him happy somehow or else he's going to find it elsewhere (which he constantly made me feel this way and demean me) I began to look back on everything, the constant utis, the bedwetting, the self harming-- I was being raped. It's only until this year I am coming to terms with what happened in 2018. I am just now trying to grieve for myself and how horribly I treated myself and was treated after losing my loved one. Hopefully my first therapy appointment this week will go okay, I'm nervous, but anything will beat these flashbacks and PTSD."
335,"I was pretty drunk and he was sober. The sex didn‚Äôt last long, but in the beginning it hurt and I wanted to tell him to stop, but he put his hand over my mouth so I couldn‚Äôt say anything. It was scary for a few seconds because I had no control. The thing is, in the beginning he asked me if I wanted to do anything and I said no. Then he started to touch me and I just went with it because I‚Äôm a doormat basically. Before we started I was clearly and overtly uncomfortable with letting him start, but he ignored it and kind of coerced me into letting him."
336,"Yesterday, a guy I was hooking up with for the first time kept asking me again and again to not use a condom. He used all of the usual arguments (""But I'm clean,"" ""I'll pull out,"" ""I won't be able to feel anything if we use a condom""), but what surprised me was how insistent he was; he kept repeating all of these things multiple times. He seemed mildly angry at me. When I said that the withdrawal method is only like 80% effective because you can get pregnant from pre-cum, he flat out told me I was wrong and kept arguing with me.

At this point, I had no desire to have sex with him anymore; my attraction to him completely evaporated. At the same time, it didn't even occur to me to try to back out at that point because I've been sexually assaulted in the past and I was scared to ask him to leave. I kept insisting on the condom and we had sex. It's hard to describe, but I felt like a completely different person took my place. It wasn't a classic dissociative experience because I didn't see myself from a third-person perspective, but I felt like I were kind of trapped inside myself. It's confusing to me that this other person who took my place seemed to enjoy the sex. The self that feels like the real me felt and still feels completely disgusted and degraded. Today I've been alternating constantly between feeling completely emotionless in an almost robotic way and feeling incredibly sad.

Does this qualify as sexually coercive behavior on his part or am I overreacting to it because of past trauma? I would really appreciate an outside perspective on this."
337,"today is my second day sober since i was raped two months ago. i‚Äôm really struggling, does anyone have any advice? now that i‚Äôm sober all i can think about is the assault. it‚Äôs like i can still feel his hands on me and still see the bruises. how do i keep these intrusive thoughts at bay?"
338,"When I was 16 and 17 I had sex with a 20-something year old DJ in chicago named Johnny Love. I lived in Michigan and we would chat on MySpace. He would convince me, beg me, to send him pictures. No matter how many times I said no, he‚Äôd keep asking. He was a big time important guy and I took it as flattery. 

When I was 19, I went to one of his famous parties with a date. I ended up getting left behind by my date so I found Johnny. Around that time, I lost consciousness. A few people found me and took me home to their place where I eventually got a ride to the hospital. Someone at that party drugged me. 

The emergency room refused me a rape kit because I had had consensual sex earlier in the night with my date. I reached out to Johnny and others at the party and none of them gave me any info on what had happened. I completely lost an evening. 

Johnny Love used his social clout to get nudes from me at 16. His MySpace page used to tout his interest in girls with pigtails and braces. He liked them young. I know I‚Äôm not the only one out there who finds this behavior gross and I worry that me keeping quiet about it means he‚Äôs still out there getting young and vulnerable girls to do things their brains aren‚Äôt ready to consent to. "
339,"Please help I'm a 17 year old high school girl and I don't know what to do

When I was younger, maybe about 7-8 years old I was sleeping between  my stepdad and my mom when all of a sudden my stepdad put his hand in my pants. He didn't do anything, his hand was just there until I started moving and his hand immediately left.

Growing up I didn't think anything of it, it honestly felt so surreal like it didn't happen, if thag makes sense? I'm 17 now and nothing happened since so I always just left it alone. 

However, 2 am on Sunday my stepdad came in my room and this literally never happens so I was pretty confused. He played it off like he heard something drop so he came to check on me? Nothing fell so I told him I was fine and turned around to go back to sleep thinking he would leave. He didn't and instead he just laid down next to me. Again, he never comes in my room let alone lays down in my bed, so this was all really weird for me, but I just kept pretending to go to sleep. A few minutes later and I felt his hand go around me so that his hand was on my stomach where my shirt was lifted a little from sleeping. Red flag and I started panicking at this point and my heart was beating so fast, but I stayed still bc I didn't know what to do. His hand starts moving down until it's about 2 inches? away from actually touching something and it stays there this whole time as he's rubbing it? I kept thinking he was gonna go lower and my heart was pretty much beating out of my chest at this point and I really thought I was gonna die. Nothing happened that time and he left eventually.

Just now, at about 2 am on Monday, he came back in my room and this time his hands were everywhere, touching my back and my groping my boobs and rubbing me down there and fingering and grabbing my ass and all I did was lay still because I still had no idea what I should do. This lasted for maybe 20 minutes but it felt so much longer than that. 

He just left and I typed this out and I really have no idea what to do. I've told my best friend about this and that's it. i don't know if I want to tell anyone else because I am so scared but I just want it to stop please please help"
340,"I am terrified. I am 20 years old and due to my hyper religious family have not had the ability to have any STD testing of any kind until now. I moved out three weeks ago and ended up going to urgent care shortly after moving after being on my period for 3+ weeks. It has stopped since then. I didn‚Äôt get tested after being raped at work by a coworker when I was 18 and the urgent care physician told me to get a Pap smear. I was fine but nervous, I saw a video of someone describing the process of a Pap smear and I‚Äôm freaking out. I would rather die than have that done and I‚Äôm about to cancel my appointment."
341,"It is easy to show support when the alleged offender is public enemy #1. But now, in the case of Joe Biden,  is when your true convictions are shown.

342,"Well, this is the story on how my brother raped me. It mat be long idk... But here goes.

 I was 13 and we had just came back from another country to move back into US. My brother (11 years of age) already did tons of abuse to me already like hitting me, touching me in places and yelling horrible stuff at me (he still does). We are at a friends house on the 2nd floor in one of the rooms. About 4 friends, my brother and I were just hanging out in this bedroom while the parents were downstairs talking about adult shit.

 It was all fun and games but then my brother decides to grab my arms, I quickly tell him to stop but he doesn't. He pushes me onto the bed while he is still on top of me. The friends don't do anything except laugh and cheer him on. He starts thrusting his hips onto mine, I'm begging for him to stop. He keeps making these sounds like he was enjoying this. I can't move because I'm way weaker than him since he does karate and excerise a lot. This goes on for several minutes although it felt like hours. The friends instead of helping me, continue to laugh. My ""friends"" weren't even moving, they were laughing at me. I have never felt like such a fucking toy.

 This isn't the only case where he does something sexual, he's slapped and fingered my ass, and he enjoys this. Whenever he gets close, I just feel an immediate panic, I feel like he'll try to hit me, yell at me, or something worse. I haven't told many people because I don't wanna be looked at as the ""kid who got fucked by his little brother"".

 I lost my virginity to someone I loved and cared for several years yet I hated it because It wasn't my wife or my girlfriend in the future, it was my brother and his disgusting way of stealing it. I used to be calm before that but that one thing... That fucking destroyed me. I started getting bad grades at school and made myself look dumb so that people could laugh and smile, because thats what made me smile. The more time after, the more wild my actions got. This summer though it was like I saw myself and realized how idiotic I was, so I decided to no longer do wild actions in the next school I would go to and that I would attempt to do well at school. Now, just getting touched or hugged reminds me of... That... I just can't stand the thought of fucking someone because it'll remind me of how my brother did that to me. I can't stand the thought of loving someone so deeply because I did that to my brother and look what happened. He still yells at me, hugs me seductively (I don't like him hugging me yet he comes from no where to do it with the most smug look on his face), and I'm just sick of it. In fact, I am getting really sick from it... The very thought that a younger sibling can be so evil and so noncaring makes me sick to the bones. This is the big reason I don't want a girlfriend, because at the end of the day she'll probably remind me of him... She'll probably want to do some stuff that will remind me of him... She will probably say something that will remind me of the event.

The worst part hasn't yet to come though, I can't say anything to the police or to anyone who could help. My mom has been protecting him from any problems and if I were ever to say a word to my dad or amybody who would put him to jail, she'd probably punish me and hate me for the rest of my life. I can only talk about this problem to those who do not know me and cannot help me, I will never be helped and my brother will probably never get a true punishment for the years of torture that he has done and still does. I will always have to be silent even when I just want a little bit of help. I will always be a supporter of metoo but will never say who I am or who raped, hit, abused and humiliated me. If you are going through something similiar, I am truly sorry. I wish I could help you but I am only an individual behind a screen that you'll never know irl

Thanks for reading this, I would love to hear some advice because honestly, dealing with this problem is like carrying a 50 pound rock on my back 24/7 and I'd just want to put it down"
343,"There is so much more to express about my (former) step-dad, but I'll keep it short.

My SD, we'll call him Dave, and my mother started dating when I was a toddler and married when I was young. They then had two additional kids together; they are 4 and 6 years my junior. I called him Dad for much of my life, but my views have since changed.

Growing up, I would have nightmares often and would crawl in bed with my mom and Dave for comfort. I remember times where he would grab my chest. I would say something, but he would just joke it off as he thought I was my mom in the middle of the night. For most of my life I went with that excuse. It wasn't until I was an adult, I realized those times he used that excuse, I was maybe 8 years old and definitely didn't have a body of a grown woman. Still not fully awful but when paired with other shit he said to me growing up, it adds up to questionable behavior.

When I matured into a young lady, I definitely had matured. I was thin but with a noticeable chest. He would make comments all of the time about my growing bosom, which made me greatly uncomfortable. Again, I brushed it off as just part of his personality and also part of his ""oh I was drunk"" excuse.

I remember specific incidents of him reading his Playboys in front of me in our living room, pointing out women, and saying, ""Oh, Annie, you have a much better body than this girl. You'll definitely be in a centerfold some day or at least you should."" Again, brushed off.

My mother and Dave divorced when I was 17. Awful departure, and luckily, made me realize how truly awful he was as a father. My mom passed when I was 27, and her death showed me again how much I loathed him as a human. 

I am a 37 y/o woman with girls of my own. I don't know how to reason these feelings and describe what he did to me. What would you call his abuse? Would it qualify as abuse?"
344,"It hurt in kindergarten when I was laying on the floor during nap time and the boy next to me reached over to feel my backside.

It hurt in middle school when I had to watch my friends be inappropriately touched by a boy in my class, the school doing nothing about it, not believing us until another boy stepped up and told on him.

It hurt in sixth grade when parents of my friends spread rumors that I was having sex, blaming me for their son‚Äôs behaviors.

It hurt when I was twelve, when a main concern was putting me on birth control so I wouldn‚Äôt get pregnant if I was raped.

It hurt my first time, when I thought he loved me as he pushed my face into the basement carpet, leaving with rug burns on my knees and tears down my face.

It hurt in high school when my friends joked every group needed a slut.

It hurt in college when my boyfriend insisted on a threesome, cheating on me when I said no to the girl he brought home.

It hurt when my business-law professor called me ‚Äúevery little boy‚Äôs fantasy,‚Äù making it impossible to want to go to class that year.

It hurt when simply saying no to a date meant I was a bitch, even when they were my friend first.
It hurt when I couldn‚Äôt cross my legs because he used his spit instead of lube, ignoring me when I said I was in pain.

It hurt when my boyfriend drugged me at the game, waking up the next morning to ‚Äúthat was great sex babe,‚Äù but not knowing because I was blacked out with no memory of that night.

It hurt when my best friend kissed me, upset that he couldn‚Äôt blame it on being drunk as if he needed an excuse to want me.

But Who Would Want Me?

The girl who has been touched, kissed and bruised by all?

The girl who wears her sexuality on her sleeve because that is all she has ever known?

The girl who helped someone cheat when they told me they had left her to love me?

Who Would Want me?

The girl with mostly guy friends because only they got the sex jokes, the ones I said to cover my fears.
The girl who is overly confident but still afraid of letting people in because they will only leave in the end.

The girl who is not afraid to speak the truth about unwanted advances, touches and rape.

The girl who knows her heart cannot handle any more pain.

Who would want me
when everything hurts?"
345,"When I was a little girl, I was raped by a family member. I remember small details, which is funny how our minds can remember the little details over the actual trurma. I remember my mother was working for target and she wrote down the stores number so that if ever I needed her while she was at work I could call her. It was next the phone that night. I remember this person (I won't name who or what their relation was to me because it no longer matters) had shut the bedroom door and I remember that was a red flag for me even at 5 years old. They wanted to play a game and exposed themselves to me, asked me if I wanted to touch them and again I remember everything in my tiny little body and soul told me this wasn't okay. I messed up and told them I needed to call my mom. Obviously that wasn't okay with them and I fought to grab the number and phone to call for help, however was also so terrified that I would get in trouble if I made any loud noises. They ate the paper that had the number on it. They pulled my pants down and then grabbed me by the hair and made me kiss their privates. After that I blocked out what happened and when I came back I was naked, alone, curled up in a ball on my parents bed crying. I remember getting up, getting dressed, and going straight to the bathroom doing my best not to make any sounds so the adults wouldn't see me (I was supposed to be asleep and didn't want to get in trouble). I remember so clearly and loudly that I felt dirty, shameful, and wrong after this happened again at only 5 years old. I decided not to say anything because again I was afraid of getting in trouble, afraid that my mom and dad would be mad at me and absolutely terrified at what the other adults would do if they found out. It wasn't until after a while that my mom noticed I was jumpy and would cry whenever it was time for me to take a bath. I didn't want to be naked around her or anyone else. I changed, I was no longer the little girl I use to be and I think for a while no one really noticed because I had also just lost my nana (grandma) to cancer. When I finally told my mom though, her and my dad flipped out on that person and the adults. However after that it was basically swepped under the rug and no one talked about it once it was finally acknowledged. For years after that I struggled because I eventually blocked out the actual trauma. So much so that as I got older and got closer to friends as we were sharing our childhood stories I would nonchalantly bring up the fact that I was raped and didn't really feel any emotion about it. Saying I was raped was as easy as saying I brushed my teeth everyday or that I went to go see a movie. I didn't realize that I was suffering from PTSD up until I was 18 and was in an intimate relationship with someone I cared for deeply. Before that I was never able to fully understand why I would lash out on boys/men. Being with my first real love opened my eyes though when I had my first panic attack during sex. Luckily he respected me and instead of flipping out on me, he just held me and let me cry. Unfortunately I wasn't always lucky and sometimes when I'd have a panic attack during sex with others, I was labeled crazy or too much to handle. Some guys would hit me, some would yell, some would even just say fuck this and leave which has left me with a not so healthy sex life or even healthy relationships. Even now I'm still suffering from something that happened almost 22 years ago. I have outbursts, I feel like I can't trust anyone with my child in fear that someone will hurt him, I have emotional break downs, and even self sabotage, because even after almost 22 years, I feel shameful and I feel that I am someone that will never be loved by another because I am dirty. I love myself, however I don't love my body and I know for some that might not make any sense but maybe to others who have also been through what I have it does."
346,"About 5 years ago my now wife raped me(30m). I‚Äôve never told anyone this and just wanted to get it off my chest.

I was drunk and despite me clearly saying no / I don‚Äôt want to several times, she climbed on top of me inserted my junk inside her and rode me until I came. I felt violated afterwards but I‚Äôm not sure she has ever really given it a second thought, let alone thought of it as her having raped me.

I‚Äôll also take the opportunity to point out that in the UK it‚Äôs actually not legally possible for a woman to rape a man through forced penetration."
347,"I just got home from visiting friends for the holidays. The transmission is out on my car, so one friend picked me up (3 hour drive each way) and another friend was supposed to drive me home. The friend who was supposed to drive me home asked if I would mind riding back home with someone she knew who was going in my direction. She assured me that she had known him for a long time and he was a good guy. 

I have a lot of stuff with me as well as my dog. About 45 minutes into the trip he shows me his loaded 9 mm gun.  I'm terrified of guns. About an hour later, he says that I should be happy he is bringing me home and how would I like to express my appreciation? He puts the center console up and tries to pull me across the seat. He attempts to put my hand on his crotch. 

I pulled back and let him know that he could stop and let me out. He didn't. He brought me all the way home and then asked if he could come in and ""be thanked.""

I gathered my stuff and my dog, got in the house and slammed and locked the door. 

I called my friend immediately to tell her what he had done and she said I must have misunderstood. He would never do something like that. 

I'm shaken. What a way to end the holidays. "
348,"Before I begin I would just like to say this is in no way bashing on the current protests and Black Lives Matter movement going through American and the world. I support the cause and hope that even though things may uncertain that we are able to grow stronger from it!

Ok with that aside I‚Äôll get into the story.

Back when I was 16 (19 now), I had been with a guy that had verbally and mentally abused me along with sexually assaulted me. I was young and just thought it was all right because he loved me, but I realized that‚Äôs not what love is. Now a few years later I am proud to say that I‚Äôm no longer depressed nor panic when people touch me. While I do still hold a lot of anxiety, I‚Äôve gotten better with opening up physically and mentally with people! I was lucky that he left town for college and never saw him around, he was just a bad person that I didn‚Äôt need in my life.

Getting to present day I hardly think about him or the rough times, but I had saw that he and a few other people from my town had organized a peaceful protest and it pissed me off. I understand these two issues do not go hand in hand and that he could just want equality for all. But to me I find it hard to believe that he could be able to do everything he did to me, yet be out there leading people to better lives. I‚Äôm trying to not make this sound horrible because I know that this movement is an important one for all, but I just hate that so many people are looking up to him and following him when they have no idea how he treated me and abused me in the past. It just seems like a hypocritical thing to do and it‚Äôs bothering me more than I care to admit!

Are my feelings justified? I feel horrible for even thinking this way, but it‚Äôs just the truth. I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs a specific word or feeling that I am feeling, but it just doesn‚Äôt sit right with me :/"

350,"I wasn't really sure where to share this, but I need to vent something that happened to me at 26, and truly all my life.

But it really starts at when I was 3, molested by a close family member. I'm not sure if I could consider it one of my first memories. Actually, the first was me seeing my parents being intimate while watching porn. I was one, but anyway, I was then assaulted again at 7 by a babysitter. 

All the while dealing with men in my neighborhood approaching me and other kids, asking us to get money from our parents so we could all go back to their house and drink. The numerous times I would be chased by unknown cars. 

Or the time when my friend and I were biking, and a car pulled up next to us. I don't know what possessed me to look down into the car. I was far enough away, I guess maybe I felt safe. But it was a man masturbating. Asking me where the fairgrounds were. 

The weird looks from men in public when I was still too young to have breasts. I'm not sure if you can understand the looks I am speaking on. Like you know what they are thinking, and it would make my stomach turn. I would almost always throw up from it. 

Mind you, by this point I had blocked out the assault at 3 and 7. Until I was raped at 14. Then it all came flooding back. Walking back home after it had occured there was a cop. So, naturally I went to him because I was always told I could trust cops, and said I was raped. He looked me dead in my face, and asked me what I had done. I felt so much more defeated. Like my soul had been cracked by the rape, but that cop shattered any hope I could have had in that moment. I went home and washed away the evidence.

Two months later, that rapist went on to rape a 12 year old. He was 22, and as far as I know was never brought to justice. Something I do still live with is that guilt that I could have still pressed forth. 

Then teenage years came and friends brothers as well as my brothers friends began looking at me differently. And would say lewd things which was very confusing.

I did get therapy for the rapes and all that, but the most recent I did not. Which brings me to this...

At 26, I got together with an old time friend. We were gonna go watch suicide squad. We were really early, so he said let's go back to my house and smoke a blunt. I thought I knew this man. He had never shown any kind of predatory behavior that I had seen. He held me in his house for about 12 hours. Beat and raped me. Then dropped me off like... It was some awesome date. 

I stupidly didn't go to the cops. I just... Didn't feel I would get any justice. And that happened during a time my sister in law passed away on Christmas Eve, was revived, then died the 29th. My uncle killed himself about 3 months later. 

I feel like I was... Born to be a sexual object, I guess. I don't know. My whole existence has been just sexual horror."
351,How do you perceive them? What kind of discussions have they generated? How have men reacted? 
352,"I felt I had nowhere to go. It‚Äôs pretty late where I am, and I had a pretty rough night. 2 weeks ago I was sexually assaulted for the second time . I said no out loud , and I know it was something I 100% was not ok with and made clear. I was very picky about who I discussed it with, because my other assaults I had a lot of shame and guilt that I‚Äôve worked hard to not let get to me. I have a close girlfriend who I felt would be judgy , but I told her anyways . Tonight after a couple drinks, and me confronting her on a problem she said ‚Äúnobody gets raped more than once , you were literally asking for it.‚Äù I‚Äôm not proud of myself , but I punched her and it brought back a lot
Of anger and ptsd for me. Least to say this person is not the friend I thought they would be , and like I said not proud of my actions . Just hearing someone say that, after I‚Äôve worked so hard and told myself it really isn‚Äôt my fault was really rough. Everyday , I wonder why I‚Äôve been raped so much. And I work very hard to not blame myself . I just was going to post to see if anyone could relate, or was available to reach out. I am in a pretty rough spot ."
353,"I feel like I need to get this out into the ether somehow and somewhere, just so I have it down.

In the summer of 2015 I volunteered at a marine conservation 'charity' (chronic shitshow, but that's another post) which was mainly comprised of people in their late teens and early twenties, myself included in the latter. I was there for four weeks and there was a strong 'hook-up' culture going on. Being single myself, and a little bit too keen, I set my eyes on one of the few people who was in their late twenties that gave off vibes for being down for casual sex - we shall call him John. Which brings me to the sex itself.

We'd escaped upstairs to this single room third floor of the main building, with everyone drinking sangria below, and kind -of-kissed-but-not-really and a few fumbles and ended up on this sofa. After perfunctory foreplay consisting of aggressive  fingering which I wasn't really into but hadn't reached the stage of my life where I could articulate what made me feel good and what didn't, John got his dick out, and leaned in to penetrate me. I said, 'wait, what about a condom?' He said, 'oh, fuck the condom!' and immediately penetrated me. He continued to aggressively fuck me until he finished, while I made all the noises I could to hasten his completion and get this gross moment over with. He pulled out and ejaculated on the blankets on the sofa and folded them to cover up his cum (fucking ew, I know). 

For so many months I regretted that encounter with John the most out of any sexual encounter I've ever had. I've had one night stands, I've had bad sex that wasn't satisfying or made me feel particularly good about myself, but I've never had an encounter like I had with him. The moment he said 'fuck the condom' and immediately, without a moment for me to insist or argue, penetrate me, something changed and at the time I didn't know what. It was pre #metoo, pre any of that kind of era so I had no benchmark or yardstick to measure what the fuck happened to me by. I wasn't raped or sexually assaulted but it was more than bad sex, more than regret. 

A year or so ago I saw an article that was discussing the tactic used by a very small number men whereby they say they're putting on a condom and then don't, or remove it halfway through intercourse. John didn't lie, pull any wool over my eyes about his intentions or anything like that. He also didn't cum inside me, thank god. I framed the desire for a condom as a question, as an option, and I shouldn't have. I should have pushed him off me and stopped him. I should have been insistent. But I wasn't. It really isn't that easy in that moment when you're with a person who is clearly treating you less than respectfully to be assertive and demand they look at you as a human being, instead of the silent vessel they want. I lay there pretending to enjoy myself when really I was willing myself to be anywhere but, worrying about STDs and pregnancy, feeling violated and filthy. It has really bothered me since reading the article last year that John did that to me and that there is a questionable spectrum of behaviour between regret and rape, this grey area where you're not being assaulted but you are being violated. 

John proceeded to refer to me as 'his girl' for a week or so afterwards when I couldn't stand to even make eye contact with him. He walked up behind me at one point and kissed my neck and I barely concealed flinching away. I later found out that he had to be kicked out of one of the other girl's bedrooms one night as he refused to leave her alone, which happened before we had sex. I wish dearly that I had known that beforehand as it probably would have really put me off him.

Thinking about it all makes me feel very ashamed and dirty, which is typical of a sexual assault victim/ survivor but I really wouldn't consider myself among them, as there really is much worse to endure than simply having sex without a condom. I'm also annoyed that the situation has me feeling so conflicted about the ethical and moral blurred line on which it exists, and about where I stand in the realm of victimhood. It's made it difficult to process and therefore accept and move on."
354,"When I was 13, I lost my virginity. I thought I was grown. But, I continued to have sex, but they were way older than me. The guy was my older brothers best friend, he was 22. I was 13. My brother supplied the condom as if he didn‚Äôt know what was going on. All of the guys who I slept with were around that age and they never had any problems with it. But, neither did I. I thought I was old enough. I was sexually assaulted when I was 14 buy a guy I told I only wanted to be friends. I invited him over to watch movies because I was alone and didn‚Äôt want to be. He took advantage. The last guy I slept with before I may my wonderful fianc√©, was 26. I was 15. I wish I could tell him how I feel. I wish I could tell him how fucked up he is. I wish I could tell him how much I hate him. He lived with my mom, stepdad and I. So I couldn‚Äôt get away. He would come into my room without knocking and stay there. Thinking at we were in a relationship after I told him to stop. But he didn‚Äôt. He would touch me continuously. He would come in the bathroom while I showered. I have so much anger and frustration built up for this man. I wish I could tell my mom but, she would blame it on me. I didn‚Äôt wear revealing clothes. I didn‚Äôt do anything but be there. I just needed to get this off of my chest."
355,"[Update to this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/meToo/comments/bkxm4w/do_i_have_a_reason_to_be_angry_anymore/) I sent a group text to the three women who were in high school with me to clear the air before our 20 year reunion coming up in case I decide to go. I don't want to have tension at the main get-together. It's early so I know it will be awhile before I get a response but my stomach is in knots right now.   


UPDATE: More info in comments, pic of response"
356,"Hello! This is my first time in this community but I‚Äôve got a lot of feelings and it seems nobody understands. Here goes. 

I work in a small office and am one of the youngest women (31) and I am nice to everyone, especially those I work next to. 
My department is very small- 4 other people. 2 are close to my age, one is my boss and the other an older guy in his 50s. 
When I started working there, we did the whole ‚Äútell us about you‚Äù thing and I told my team I play roller derby. Older guy in his 50s, we will call him Peter (not his real name) was immediately interested in it and wouldn‚Äôt stop asking me questions. 
A few weeks later he told me he bought tickets for him and his wife to come to my game. No big, right? 
After that he invited me over for dinner... I declined, and then I ended up in some relationship turmoil and Peter got very... protective over me? I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs the right word. It was strange. 
He came over to my cubical more often just to chat, and kept standing closer and closer to me. I noticed he doesn‚Äôt do that to the other 2 women in our area. He started texting me and Facebook messaging me outside of business hours, none of them I replied to. 
This last Monday when I left work, he called me. I didn‚Äôt answer. But he called. That‚Äôs weird. 
My friend in the office started noticing all of this and asked me about it and was concerned since he doesn‚Äôt treat her this way. 
Wednesday morning I got to work early before anyone else because I needed to catch up on some stuff from when I was out of town. I had my headphones in and was facing my computer. Peter came up from behind me and hugged me, hands resting over my breasts, and lingered. I completely froze. There‚Äôs a flight or fight mode right? There‚Äôs also a freeze mode and that‚Äôs me. I couldn‚Äôt move or talk. I was in shock. Not once have I given any indication that touching me was ok. He hasn‚Äôt asked for my consent. Nothing. 
I told my boss a couple hours later and she went to HR about it. I was told not to say anything to Peter; nothing like ‚Äústop‚Äù or ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt do this I‚Äôm uncomfortable.‚Äù 
Wednesday ended and I heard nothing from HR. Thursday... nothing. 
Friday was my day to stay late. Everyone had left except Peter and myself, of course. HE DID IT AGAIN and his hand lingered on my lower back. I wrote an email to HR asking when I could expect to hear something because it happened again. 
I‚Äôm upset for multiple reasons. 
1) Why did I freeze both times? 
2) Why did this start on Wednesday and 2 days had passed and I had heard nothing from HR? 
3) Why do I feel like it‚Äôs my fault? I know it‚Äôs not... but I can‚Äôt help feeling like maybe I did somehow let him know he could touch me (I definitely didn‚Äôt say those words at all) and why do I feel disgusting and like I want to crawl into a hole and die? 
Ugh."
357,"I just sent an email to my abuser, who keeps trying to contact me, calling him out for what he did. I used a lot more expletives than typical for myself. And holy fuck. I cant believe I just did that. I'm freaking out."
358,"I started dating my ex when I was 16 and he was 19. We started having sex when I was 17, and it seemed pretty healthy up until about 3-4 years later when he stopped respecting me saying no. He would pout, beg, push, and sometimes just leave our apartment if I said I didn‚Äôt want to have sex with him. It got to the point where I would say yes just to keep the peace. There were a couple times where he‚Äôd manipulate a yes out of me, but I‚Äôd try to stop him during sex and he wouldn‚Äôt listen. He would say ‚Äúbut I‚Äôm almost done, let me finish‚Äù or just go harder so he would orgasm quicker. He ended up cheating on me and dumping me for his mistress. I slept with one of his friends maybe a month after we broke up (super unhealthy, I know) and was okay with it, but since then the thought of sex sends me into a panic. I tried going to the gyno and didn‚Äôt even make it to my appointment because I had a panic attack in the waiting room. I‚Äôve tried dating a couple times, but as soon as the guy just kisses me, I shut down. It‚Äôs been two years since my relationship and I still just feel so sexually lost."
359,"When I was 17 a very close family friend sexually assaulted me. He was over 50 and I knew and trusted him my entire life. He wanted me to model for his so he could draw me, which he did all throughout my childhood, but this time he got his camera out and made me take off my clothes. I didnt know what to do and didnt want to make a scene or misinterpret anything so I let it happen and did nothing. I've been to therapy for this and even filed a police report. Its been over 3 years and I still haven't told my bf. I've been too ashamed to say anything, especially since the assault happened when we were together. 
Another victim, who was much much younger when assaulted, is going to court and asked if I could be a witness to his crimes. I said that I would but I would need to tell my bf the truth soon."
360,"My (19F) stepdad started massaging me (even though i never asked for it). He started from my lover back and moved his hands closer and closer to my butt and started rubbing it (i was 16 then).
I asked him what he was doing and he said ‚Äúnothing‚Äù, I told him to stop. We were sitting on the couch (i was sitting at the edge but he moved closer). We were watching TV, and my sister was in the bathroom. Fortunately my sister walked out of the bathroom with flash on her tablet and flashed his face, which made him panic and quickly moved his hands off my body. 

Before that, I couldn‚Äôt process what was happening to me. I was frozen. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. All I could hear was ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you like it?‚Äù i stayed quiet. I wish I could‚Äôve said something because what he was doing made me really uncomfortable. 

I told my mom everything and she confronted him about it. The bastard denied everything. He even tried to justify his actions with the fact that i talked to people online and he could be in trouble if i sent ‚Äúhalf naked pictures‚Äù to a guy. Now I wasn‚Äôt dumb enough to buy his excuse. I know if I was to send a picture to someone he wouldn‚Äôt be in trouble since he‚Äôs not the one receiving it. I know he was scared of being caught, I can bet he has pics of underaged on his devices. What a creep. 

Keep in mind he checked everything I did on my tablet (I didn‚Äôt have a phone) he saw every pictures i had (which is invasion of privacy) but i couldn‚Äôt do anything about it. At this point he thinks I wanted to have sex with him just because i took a picture of my tan line on my shoulders. He tried to brainwash my mom and telling her how much of a trouble maker i am. 

I threatened to call the police and he said our lives would be over if I did. He even tried to ‚Äúbribe‚Äù me by buying me the brand new iPhone 8 which was recently released (September 22, 2017 in my current country).

Fast forward to 2018 I finally got my mother on my side after years of battling with my trauma and depression. I suffered from stress at school as well. 

I just graduated and have no intention of continuing any studies. I still get flashbacks from time to time and I‚Äôve been trying to cope with it. 

My mother always taught me that peace is the only way. But every time he‚Äôs around me, the only thing i want to do is k*ll him. But i love my mother and don‚Äôt want to be a m*rderer. 
But if I could, I would.

I hate my stepdad. I want my mother to divorce and leave him as soon as she can."
361,"Every time I was ever molested my mom was the one who put me in the situation...... I know that sounds like a long stretch...... but aside from when I was raped every time would of been a result of her actions...



-First time was at my grandparents my step grandpa was a fucking creep, no one in the family believes me even now, but when I was little my mom left us at my grandparents a lot as kids.... papaw as we called him would always ignore all the kids but me and ask me to climb on his back or lap constantly or ask me to fix his hair or just rub his scalp for him....... he always requested kisses on the lips when I left no one else had to...... he would play cards a lot poker specifically... 


He called me ‚Äúhis good luck charm‚Äù would grab me from any room even when asleep and put me on his lap to play poker with me there as his charm...... I told my parents I didn‚Äôt like this cause papaw always had a toothbrush or stick in his pocket and it hurt to sit on.... they continued to make me go there till I was 15 he even tried to help me potty and change and bathe numerous times none of the other 25 grandkids got that treatment. 

-Second time I was told my uncle was moving into live with us, he would sleep on a air mattress in the computer room till he found a place (20 years later dude still lives with my parents) he would baby sit us for my parents if they had to do stuff .... his baby sitting was turn on tv and jerk off in computer room to little Asian girls ...... anyways one day I walked in on him it was a kid like me in the screen with her mouth open.. he saw me continued to pull on himself and asked what I wanted I said I needed lunch but no anymore and ran, I was scared of my room next to his so I asked to sleep on the couch outside my parents room..... till one night I woke up to someone touching my breasts and moaning... he was jerking off over me.... then noticed me awake and pretended to be sleep walking .... told my mom she said I was lying and to stop being gross...... 


-third time I stayed with an aunt and uncle (preacher uncle) in another state cause my mom was upset with me bout beginning my teen angst years..... while trying to sleep the uncle came in my room and tried to sleep big spoon little spoon with me with a full erection I cried and ran to my aunt and she slept in a room with me said uncle was drunk...... (month later uncle got caught soliciting sex from a minor that was a cop undercover)


-fourth time I needed a ride home from a school play cause I didn‚Äôt drive my mom and dad wanted to leave and go to bed but a cast party was happening after I wanted to go to... so she asked my guy friend of mine I didn‚Äôt know very well but that had a car to take me home after the party....... he agreed.... he was younger then me by two years ..... after the party I get in his car he helps me buckle and I thank him we get close to my house and he starts trying to rip open my shirt and fondle my breasts says he won‚Äôt take me home till I let him suck in my breasts...... I developed a 40H breast by age 15 so this obviously was something I heard a lot so I laughed and pushed him away he threw me out the moving car in front of my house by undoing my belt when I wasn‚Äôt looking and shoving me out the door he opened while leaning over me..... his dad was a cop so he didn‚Äôt get anything for me reporting it ...... he has a YouTube channel now that is pretty successful that I occasionally comment on the videos of about him being a monster....



All times she couldn‚Äôt of been bothered with me so she left me in a monsters hands I‚Äôm just saying facts are there "
362,"Yes, Uma Thurman is mad.

She has been raped. She has been sexually assaulted. She has been mangled in hot steel. She has been betrayed and gaslighted by those she trusted.

And we‚Äôre not talking about her role as the blood-spattered bride in ‚ÄúKill Bill.‚Äù We‚Äôre talking about a world that is just as cutthroat, amoral, vindictive and misogynistic as any Quentin Tarantino hellscape.

We‚Äôre talking about Hollywood, where even an avenging angel has a hard time getting respect, much less bloody satisfaction.

Playing foxy Mia Wallace in 1994‚Äôs ‚ÄúPulp Fiction‚Äù and ferocious Beatrix Kiddo in ‚ÄúKill Bill,‚Äù Volumes 1 (2003) and 2 (2004), Thurman was the lissome goddess in the creation myth of Harvey Weinstein and Quentin Tarantino. The Miramax troika was the ultimate in indie cool. A spellbound Tarantino often described his auteur-muse relationship with Thurman ‚Äî who helped him conceive the idea of the bloody bride ‚Äî as an Alfred Hitchcock-Ingrid Bergman legend. (With a foot fetish thrown in.) But beneath the glistening Oscar gold, there was a dark undercurrent that twisted the triangle.

‚ÄúPulp Fiction‚Äù made Weinstein rich and respected, and Thurman says he introduced her to President Barack Obama at a fund-raiser as the reason he had his house.

‚ÄúThe complicated feeling I have about Harvey is how bad I feel about all the women that were attacked after I was,‚Äù she told me one recent night, looking anguished in her elegant apartment in River House on Manhattan‚Äôs East Side, as she vaped tobacco, sipped white wine and fed empty pizza boxes into the fireplace.
‚ÄúI am one of the reasons that a young girl would walk into his room alone, the way I did. Quentin used Harvey as the executive producer of ‚ÄòKill Bill,‚Äô a movie that symbolizes female empowerment. And all these lambs walked into slaughter because they were convinced nobody rises to such a position who would do something illegal to you, but they do.‚Äù

Thurman stresses that Creative Artists Agency, her former agency, was connected to Weinstein‚Äôs predatory behavior. It has since issued a public apology. ‚ÄúI stand as both a person who was subjected to it and a person who was then also part of the cloud cover, so that‚Äôs a super weird split to have,‚Äù she says.

She talks mordantly about ‚Äúthe power from ‚ÄòPulp,‚Äô‚Äù and reminds me that it‚Äôs in the Library of Congress, part of the American narrative.

When asked about the scandal on the red carpet at the October premiere for her Broadway play, ‚ÄúThe Parisian Woman,‚Äù an intrigue about a glamorous woman in President Trump‚Äôs Washington written by ‚ÄúHouse of Cards‚Äù creator Beau Willimon, she looked steely and said she was waiting to feel less angry before she talked about it.

‚ÄúI used the word ‚Äòanger‚Äô but I was more worried about crying, to tell you the truth,‚Äù she says now. ‚ÄúI was not a groundbreaker on a story I knew to be true. So what you really saw was a person buying time.‚Äù

By Thanksgiving, Thurman had begun to unsheathe her Hattori Hanzo, Instagramming a screen shot of her ‚Äúroaring rampage of revenge‚Äù monologue and wishing everyone a happy holiday, ‚Äú(Except you Harvey, and all your wicked conspirators ‚Äî I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs going slowly ‚Äî you don‚Äôt deserve a bullet) ‚Äî stay tuned.‚Äù
Stretching out her lanky frame on a brown velvet couch in front of the fire, Thurman tells her story, with occasional interruptions from her 5-year-old daughter with her ex, financier Arpad Busson. Luna is in her pj‚Äôs, munching on a raw cucumber. Her two older kids with Ethan Hawke, Maya, an actress, and Levon, a high school student, also drop by.

In interviews over the years, Thurman has offered a Zen outlook ‚Äî even when talking about her painful breakup from Hawke. (She had a brief first marriage to Gary Oldman.) Her hall features a large golden Buddha from her parents in Woodstock; her father, Robert Thurman, is a Buddhist professor of Indo-Tibetan studies at Columbia who thinks Uma is a reincarnated goddess.

But beneath that reserve and golden aura, she has learned to be a street fighter.

She says when she was 16, living in a studio apartment in Manhattan and starting her movie career, she went to a club one winter night and met an actor, nearly 20 years older, who coerced her afterward when they went to his Greenwich Village brownstone for a nightcap.

‚ÄúI was ultimately compliant,‚Äù she remembers. ‚ÄúI tried to say no, I cried, I did everything I could do. He told me the door was locked but I never ran over and tried the knob. When I got home, I remember I stood in front of the mirror and I looked at my hands and I was so mad at them for not being bloody or bruised. Something like that tunes the dial one way or another, right? You become more compliant or less compliant, and I think I became less compliant.‚Äù

Thurman got to know Weinstein and his first wife, Eve, in the afterglow of ‚ÄúPulp Fiction.‚Äù ‚ÄúI knew him pretty well before he attacked me,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe used to spend hours talking to me about material and complimenting my mind and validating me. It possibly made me overlook warning signs. This was my champion. I was never any kind of studio darling. He had a chokehold on the type of films and directors that were right for me.‚Äù

Things soon went off-kilter in a meeting in his Paris hotel room. ‚ÄúIt went right over my head,‚Äù she says. They were arguing about a script when the bathrobe came out.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt feel threatened,‚Äù she recalls. ‚ÄúI thought he was being super idiosyncratic, like this was your kooky, eccentric uncle.‚Äù
He told her to follow him down a hall ‚Äî there were always, she says, ‚Äúvestibules within corridors within chambers‚Äù ‚Äî so they could keep talking. ‚ÄúThen I followed him through a door and it was a steam room. And I was standing there in my full black leather outfit ‚Äî boots, pants, jacket. And it was so hot and I said, ‚ÄòThis is ridiculous, what are you doing?‚Äô And he was getting very flustered and mad and he jumped up and ran out.‚Äù

The first ‚Äúattack,‚Äù she says, came not long after in Weinstein‚Äôs suite at the Savoy Hotel in London. ‚ÄúIt was such a bat to the head. He pushed me down. He tried to shove himself on me. He tried to expose himself. He did all kinds of unpleasant things. But he didn‚Äôt actually put his back into it and force me. You‚Äôre like an animal wriggling away, like a lizard. I was doing anything I could to get the train back on the track. My track. Not his track.‚Äù

She was staying in Fulham with her friend, Ilona Herman, Robert De Niro‚Äôs longtime makeup artist, who later worked with Thurman on ‚ÄúKill Bill.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe next day to her house arrived a 26-inch-wide vulgar bunch of roses,‚Äù Thurman says. ‚ÄúThey were yellow. And I opened the note like it was a soiled diaper and it just said, ‚ÄòYou have great instincts.‚Äô‚Äù Then, she says, Weinstein‚Äôs assistants started calling again to talk about projects.

She thought she could confront him and clear it up, but she took Herman with her and asked Weinstein to meet her in the Savoy bar. The assistants had their own special choreography to lure actresses into the spider‚Äôs web and they pressured Thurman, putting Weinstein on the phone to again say it was a misunderstanding and ‚Äúwe have so many projects together.‚Äù Finally she agreed to go upstairs, while Herman waited on a settee outside the elevators.

Once the assistants vanished, Thurman says, she warned Weinstein, ‚ÄúIf you do what you did to me to other people you will lose your career, your reputation and your family, I promise you.‚Äù Her memory of the incident abruptly stops there.

Through a representative, Weinstein, who is in therapy in Arizona, agreed that ‚Äúshe very well could have said this.‚Äù

Downstairs, Herman was getting nervous. ‚ÄúIt seemed to take forever,‚Äù the friend told me. Finally, the elevator doors opened and Thurman walked out. ‚ÄúShe was very disheveled and so upset and had this blank look,‚Äù Herman recalled. ‚ÄúHer eyes were crazy and she was totally out of control. I shoveled her into the taxi and we went home to my house. She was really shaking.‚Äù Herman said that when the actress was able to talk again, she revealed that Weinstein had threatened to derail her career.

Through a spokesperson, Weinstein denied ever threatening her prospects and said that he thought she was ‚Äúa brilliant actress.‚Äù He acknowledged her account of the episodes but said that up until the Paris steam room, they had had ‚Äúa flirtatious and fun working relationship.‚Äù

‚ÄúMr. Weinstein acknowledges making a pass at Ms. Thurman in England after misreading her signals in Paris,‚Äù the statement said. ‚ÄúHe immediately apologized.‚Äù

Thurman says that, even though she was in the middle of a run of Miramax projects, she privately regarded Weinstein as an enemy after that. One top Hollywood executive who knew them both said the work relationship continued but that basically, ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt give him the time of day.‚Äù

Thurman says that she could tolerate the mogul in supervised environments and that she assumed she had ‚Äúaged out of the window of his assault range.‚Äù

She attended the party he had in SoHo in September for Tarantino‚Äôs engagement to Daniella Pick, an Israeli singer. In response to queries about Thurman‚Äôs revelations, Weinstein sent along six pictures of chummy photos of the two of them at premieres and parties over the years.

And that brings us to ‚Äúthe Quentin of it all,‚Äù as Thurman calls it. The animosity between Weinstein and Thurman infected her creative partnership with Tarantino.

Married to Hawke and with a baby daughter and a son on the way, Thurman went to the Cannes Film Festival in 2001. She says Tarantino noticed after a dinner that she was skittish around Weinstein, which was a problem, since they were all about to make ‚ÄúKill Bill.‚Äù She says she reminded Tarantino that she had already told him about the Savoy incident, but ‚Äúhe probably dismissed it like ‚ÄòOh, poor Harvey, trying to get girls he can‚Äôt have,‚Äô whatever he told himself, who knows?‚Äù But she reminded him again and ‚Äúthe penny dropped for him. He confronted Harvey.‚Äù
Later, by the pool under the Cypress trees at the luxurious Hotel du Cap, Thurman recalls, Weinstein said he was hurt and surprised by her accusations. She then firmly reiterated what happened in London. ‚ÄúAt some point, his eyes changed and he went from aggressive to ashamed,‚Äù she says, and he offered her an apology with many of the sentiments he would trot out about 16 years later when the walls caved in.

‚ÄúI just walked away stunned, like ‚ÄòO.K., well there‚Äôs my half-assed apology,‚Äô‚Äù Thurman says.

Weinstein confirmed Friday that he apologized, an unusual admission from him, which spurred Thurman to wryly note, ‚ÄúHis therapy must be working.‚Äù

Since the revelations about Weinstein became public last fall, Thurman has been reliving her encounters with him ‚Äî and a gruesome episode on location for ‚ÄúKill Bill‚Äù in Mexico made her feel as blindsided as the bride and as determined to get her due, no matter how long it took.

With four days left, after nine months of shooting the sadistic saga, Thurman was asked to do something that made her draw the line.

In the famous scene where she‚Äôs driving the blue convertible to kill Bill ‚Äî the same one she put on Instagram on Thanksgiving ‚Äî she was asked to do the driving herself.

But she had been led to believe by a teamster, she says, that the car, which had been reconfigured from a stick shift to an automatic, might not be working that well.

She says she insisted that she didn‚Äôt feel comfortable operating the car and would prefer a stunt person to do it. Producers say they do not recall her objecting.

‚ÄúQuentin came in my trailer and didn‚Äôt like to hear no, like any director,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúHe was furious because I‚Äôd cost them a lot of time. But I was scared. He said: ‚ÄòI promise you the car is fine. It‚Äôs a straight piece of road.‚Äô‚Äù He persuaded her to do it, and instructed: ‚Äú ‚ÄòHit 40 miles per hour or your hair won‚Äôt blow the right way and I‚Äôll make you do it again.‚Äô But that was a deathbox that I was in. The seat wasn‚Äôt screwed down properly. It was a sand road and it was not a straight road.‚Äù (Tarantino did not respond to requests for comment.)

Thurman then shows me the footage that she says has taken her 15 years to get. ‚ÄúSolving my own Nancy Drew mystery,‚Äù she says.
It‚Äôs from the point of view of a camera mounted to the back of the Karmann Ghia. It‚Äôs frightening to watch Thurman wrestle with the car, as it drifts off the road and smashes into a palm tree, her contorted torso heaving helplessly until crew members appear in the frame to pull her out of the wreckage. Tarantino leans in and Thurman flashes a relieved smile when she realizes that she can briefly stand.
	
‚ÄúThe steering wheel was at my belly and my legs were jammed under me,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI felt this searing pain and thought, ‚ÄòOh my God, I‚Äôm never going to walk again,‚Äô‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWhen I came back from the hospital in a neck brace with my knees damaged and a large massive egg on my head and a concussion, I wanted to see the car and I was very upset. Quentin and I had an enormous fight, and I accused him of trying to kill me. And he was very angry at that, I guess understandably, because he didn‚Äôt feel he had tried to kill me.‚Äù

Even though their marriage was spiraling apart, Hawke immediately left the Abbey of Gethsemani in Kentucky to fly to his wife‚Äôs side.

‚ÄúI approached Quentin in very serious terms and told him that he had let Uma down as a director and as a friend,‚Äù he told me. He said he told Tarantino, ‚ÄúHey, man, she is a great actress, not a stunt driver, and you know that.‚Äù Hawke added that the director ‚Äúwas very upset with himself and asked for my forgiveness.‚Äù
Two weeks after the crash, after trying to see the car and footage of the incident, she had her lawyer send a letter to Miramax, summarizing the event and reserving the right to sue.

Miramax offered to show her the footage if she signed a document ‚Äúreleasing them of any consequences of my future pain and suffering,‚Äù she says. She didn‚Äôt.

Thurman says her mind meld with Tarantino was rattled. ‚ÄúWe were in a terrible fight for years,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúWe had to then go through promoting the movies. It was all very thin ice. We had a fateful fight at Soho House in New York in 2004 and we were shouting at each other because he wouldn‚Äôt let me see the footage and he told me that was what they had all decided.‚Äù

Now, so many years after the accident, inspired by the reckoning on violence against women, reliving her own ‚Äúdehumanization to the point of death‚Äù in Mexico, and furious that there have not been more legal repercussions against Weinstein, Thurman says she handed over the result of her own excavations to the police and ramped up the pressure to cajole the crash footage out of Tarantino.

‚ÄúQuentin finally atoned by giving it to me after 15 years, right?‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúNot that it matters now, with my permanently damaged neck and my screwed-up knees.‚Äù

(Tarantino aficionados spy an echo of Thurman‚Äôs crash in his 2007 movie, ‚ÄúDeath Proof,‚Äù produced by Weinstein and starring Thurman‚Äôs stunt double, Zo√´ Bell. Young women, including a blond Rose McGowan, die in myriad ways, including by slamming into a windshield.)

As she sits by the fire on a second night when we talk until 3 a.m., tears begin to fall down her cheeks. She brushes them away.
‚ÄúWhen they turned on me after the accident,‚Äù she says, ‚ÄúI went from being a creative contributor and performer to being like a broken tool.‚Äù

Thurman says that in ‚ÄúKill Bill,‚Äù Tarantino had done the honors with some of the sadistic flourishes himself, spitting in her face in the scene where Michael Madsen is seen on screen doing it and choking her with a chain in the scene where a teenager named Gogo is on screen doing it.

‚ÄúHarvey assaulted me but that didn‚Äôt kill me,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWhat really got me about the crash was that it was a cheap shot. I had been through so many rings of fire by that point. I had really always felt a connection to the greater good in my work with Quentin and most of what I allowed to happen to me and what I participated in was kind of like a horrible mud wrestle with a very angry brother. But at least I had some say, you know?‚Äù She says she didn‚Äôt feel disempowered by any of it. Until the crash.
‚ÄúPersonally, it has taken me 47 years to stop calling people who are mean to you ‚Äòin love‚Äô with you. It took a long time because I think that as little girls we are conditioned to believe that cruelty and love somehow have a connection and that is like the sort of era that we need to evolve out of.‚Äù"
363,"I‚Äôm almost done with trauma counseling and I have been feeling overall better. I saw a post on Facebook warning high schoolers that  guys in his 20s are not dating you because ‚Äúyou‚Äôre mature for your age.‚Äù 

I forgot how many times that was said to me. Looking back, that was a grooming technique. Telling me I was ‚Äúmature for my age.‚Äù And Informing me -not asking- that we were going to get married. When I said I wasn‚Äôt sure I was ready for that since I was still in highschool he told me he wasn‚Äôt dating me to past time. He was dating me to marry me and he didn‚Äôt think I was a whore like his ex. 

It bothers me so much. I feel so helpless in this moment. Until recently I couldn‚Äôt call what happened to me rape. I just said it wasn‚Äôt consensual. It‚Äôs been 10yrs. I have gotten sober, gotten counseling and recently had sex for the first time sober. 

I feel like this doesn‚Äôt end. I want to scream at the top of my lungs to save other teenagers from going through what I went through. I want to yell at the adults who knew and made sexual jokes about me and the guy and laughed with him when I said I didn‚Äôt understand the joke.  I want to get the fuck away from every one so no one can hurt me or anyone else. I just want to scream but I can‚Äôt scream as loud as I need too, im still not strong enough. Even to fucking scream."
364,"I've never talked about this. I am one of those people who in college really valued virginity. Then life took over and many things happened. I'm embarrassed by that. I was a virgin for a long time. Too long. A part of me did want the sexual experience. A part of me knew this way was wrong.

I was in pain. My leg hurt. Constantly. 24 hours 7 days a week of constant agony. It was hard to find a doctor to take me seriously. There was nothing wrong with my leg.  Most were rather nice. I heard, ""You are at the wrong hospital"" a lot. I needed a doctor to check my back, but doing it outpatient was a horrific, slow, process. One doctor in one of the hospitals understood. He was great. He told me when he worked. He told me to come ask for him when I couldn't take it and overtook my Motrin. He would do what he could to make me comfortable. Give me scripts. Shoot me full of Dilaudid. I was seeing the doctor he recommended. Waiting for the results of the MRI. So they could tell me where to go.

And I would take cabs there and back. One cab driver took really good care of me. Really cared. We drove around looking for pot while picking people up. We shared a joint. Got liquor.

He promised me he was good at massages. OMG my leg massaged. That would feel so good. Anything. Anything to take the pain away. The wine. Anything. Things he promised to pay me back for. Doped up and drunk with liquor I bought. Percocet and pot. A massage? Oh boy. Anything.

We could go to a hotel for my massage. I couldn't go to my apartment. My neighbor started to stop taking her meds. We could tell. The cops showed up everyday when she did. And she was racist. A cab driver coming into my house. Drunk, carrying liquor. Smelling like pot. 

We drove up to an hourly place and the only thing I could focus on was the word massage. Make my leg feel better. We got a room and he told me a massage would be better naked. I didn't care. He made comments throughout that the hospital really fucked me up. I agreed.

*Just stop the pain*

Massage turned into him assulting my mouth. Shoving his dick in, hard, like my mouth was a vagina. I'm sorry, I have a horrible gag reflex. It was so uncomfortable that I kept trying to close my mouth. Finally he pulled out. Put on a condom. I said no. I insisted no. He took it off.

He massaged again. Then insisted I lick him. Like a lollipop. I tried. The pot drained my saliva. I didn't bring the wine. I hate beer. Especially his beer. He started assaulting my mouth again. Hard, uncomfortable, wanting to throw up.

He pulled out and put on a condom. No. I said no. I'm a virgin. Inside of me said it's not right. He said, ""well, I'm going to use your mouth then.""

I didn't want that. He promised it would help with pain. I told him I'm a virgin. Why I'm a virgin. But I didn't want my mouth assaulted anymore. And no pain. I could deal with no pain. No pain no pain no pain. No assault to my mouth no pain.

We had sex. My first. I got no enjoyment out of it, but he was right, for however long this disappointment lasted, the pain stopped. It stopped however long it was. We laid and talked. I didn't feel my leg hurting so I was happy. He said we had to go. 

We drove around a bit more but the pain hit worse so he brought me home. The next day it was so bad I couldn't stand up. I laid on my apartment porch for my friend. My friend taking me to the doctor. Looking at the tests.

It was a bulging disc the size of a golf ball laying, grinding my sciatic nerve. I needed surgery. I needed surgery *now*. I was rushed to the right hospital to the right care of my pain. To not degridation like I was an addict because there was nothing wrong with my leg. It was my back. I had surgery and my pain went from a horrific 10 to a mild 4. It was bliss.

I'm happy I lost my virginity. I'm happy that forever long it was this guy took it away. Deep down I'm ashamed. Deep down I feel taken advantage of. I said yes. I allowed it. It's not rape. But it's not something I would have done if the doctor didn't dope me up. I wouldn't have agreed to go anywhere but home. I was in pain and just wanted it to stop. My family is ashamed of me. Because I told my sister and she told everyone. My father called me a slut. 

I did reach out to the cab company. I did tell the hospital that doping people up and putting them in a cab with a stranger right away was a bad idea. I did my due diligence.

I feel like I did something wrong. He did something wrong. He took advantage and threatened to assault my mouth. He promised massage but he took my pain away. He took my virginity that I didn't want to give up and yet wanted to 

I don't know how to feel. Part of me says he knew. That it was still rape because he saw the opportunity. Part of me says I said yes. I said yes because my face and mouth is not a vagina. I could have left maybe? It was his cab. I didn't kno where I was. My sister only knew because I shot her an emergency text with my location. I told her I was safe, to stop texting me God damn it. I wanted that massage and fuck you. If I sent something weird then I'm in danger you idiot. Stop texting me.

But I was in danger, wasn't I? I don't know how to feel. Advice?"
365,"I feel extremely trapped and confused; I really need an outlet to speak to someone.

I have known this friend for years now and we have been platonic for the longest time. I have met his family and attended his family/ friend gatherings numerous times. Whenever he flew  to London to visit, he would sleep over and we would share the same bed. We took care and looked out from one another like good friends.

After I've returned to my home country for good, we had late night seshes where we would get lit with his  mates and I would sleep over. All was going well and normal until this happened.

Earlier this year, during one of our seshes, we got extremely baked and I was paralysed on the bed. He insisted on cuddling even though I told him to stop being weird and that he was making me really uncomfortable. He forced himself upon me but I was really incapable of moving. To my  horror, I woke up to his hand fondling my crotch. So I pushed him away and told him to stop that. I left shortly after. I didn't want to make a big fuss out of it because I took into account of our longstanding friendship. I buried those feelings within because I am not one who bears grudges and I chose to forgive him.

Two days ago, he hit me up to chill with his mates and I agreed. I thought that by declining his previous advances, he wouldn't do such a thing ever again. We were catching up like old times. Later into the night, he insisted on feeding me multiple pills of anti-depressants. I took two of them and declined everything else despite his persuasion. I fell asleep. I woke up with him pinning me down on the bed and chatting shit to me like, ""why don't you like me?"" ""your ex is fucking ugly"" And I told him to stop whatever he's doing. But he went on to kiss me and the last I recalled, I felt his tongue inside my mouth and he unhooked my bra. When I sobered up, I found myself in a different shirt. But I'm certain that no sexual intercourse happened because my trousers and panties were intact.

I woke up him and told him off about how disgusting and disrespectful he was. And that the only reason why I chose not to make a big deal out of the first incident, was because of how I valued him as a friend. He said, ""I don't remember anything, I blacked out."" That phrase, is his classic punch line whenever he did something fucked up since we were young. I went home feeling sick in the stomach.

He tried to reach out to me - multiple calls and texts telling me how sorry he is and that he wants to make up to me. Obviously, I am not going to fall for any of his ploy and I have ghosted him since that incident. I have only opened up to one friend which advised me to call the cops on him. I feel really uncomfortable doing that. I don't want to hurt his family by getting him involved with the cops and I feel like it was my fault for being so naive and trusting.

What should I do?"
366,"First of all- THIS POST IS ABOUT ME BEING SEXUALLY ASSAULTED MULTIPLE TIMES THROUGHOUT MY LIFE. THE POINT OF THIS POST IS NOT THAT ALL MEN ARE EVIL. THE POINT OF THIS POST, IS THAT ALL MEN THAT HAVE ABUSED, OR ALL PEOPLE , FOR THAT MATTER, THAT HAVE ABUSED OTHER PEOPLE ARE EVIL. ANYONE THAT FEELS LIKE I DESERVED TO BE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED HAS MOST LIKELY SEXUALLY ASSAULTED SOMEONE BEFORE AND IS A SELF PROCLAIMED PEICE OF SH*T. ANY OTHER MAN THAT FEELS THE NEED TO TELL ME THAT MY ABUSE WAS MY FAULT CAN GO F*CK THEIR MOTHER THAT WISHES THEY ABORTED THEM.

Right now it feels like being born as a woman, is a one way ticket to a life of never ending sexual assaults, harassments, and violations. If I just had a c*ck in between my legs, I wouldn‚Äôt have been through half the sh*t I‚Äôve been though. Solely because of the fact that men think it‚Äôs okay to openly objectify women. My hate for creepy men is growing so strong. I do not know how to let this anger out and it‚Äôs eating me alive. I‚Äôve been taken advantage of by the scum of the earth so many times I want to die. Why am I forced to live this existence of utter shame, disgust, anger, and degrading torture that is being abused/harassed by disgusting, creepy men. Why does evil on this planet exist? Why can‚Äôt I just not be here anymore? I‚Äôm done."
367,"TW: talk about rape/SA

To give some context to those of you who don't know Unbelievable, it's a true-crime/drama-show by Netflix revolving around the case of a serial-rapist. I personally really liked watching it despite the fact that some of the scenes definitely can be triggering. It presented the pain and suffering that rape victims have to go through very accurately, but most importantly, which is also what I want to talk about, the faults of the justice system and the police when persuing cases of sexual assault/rape.

In the first episode of the show, the protagonist Marie calls the police after getting raped in her home by a stranger, had to undergo multiple painful interrogations by the police and hospital staff, as well as undergo an intense physical examination which seemed as if would have been very triggering. 
Later on, her story didn't seem to line up with the testimonials of some of her friends, neighbors and former foster parents, which lead to her being interrogated again under the pretense that she made up her sexual assault for attention, and was bullied by the police into admitting to making it up, which she tried to fight at first, but eventually gave up on as the police didn't believe her. She even ended up getting charged for false accusations, and only years later after the case of the serial rapist was closed, evidence of her sexual assault came up, proving her innocent.

I do believe wholeheartedly that showing the ugly truth of how badly our justice system and the police treat cases of rape is necessary and should serve as a true eye opener for a lot of people, and I believe that a lot more people should watch this show in general. But, Marie's story, while it may be fictional, really discouraged me from ever speaking up about my sexual assault to anyone in my immediate life.

She ended up the way she did, because some of her former foster parents that she was still close to told the police that they were suspecting that she made her story up. Her own ""family"" doubted her and did not believe her. The police bullied her into admitting to lying about being raped even though it truly did happen. She was relentlessly harassed and bullied by all the people around her because of it, and she was criminally charged for false accusations.

My sexual assault, or rather one of them, had a lot of similarities to the one of Marie. Only that mine happened over a year ago, I never told anyone I knew, and I have not even the tiniest chance of proving that it ever happened. How would anyone ever believe me? How would anyone ever believe me that I out of all people, could had been raped by a stranger? I am deathly scared that people will say that I'm only seeking attention as well, that I made it up, that noone would even want to have sex with me wether it would be consensual or not, or that ""it wasn't even that bad"" that it wasn't rape. I was scared in the beginning that since I didn't speak up about it immediately, people wouldn't believe me because I'd be talking about it ""too soon"", that it couldn't have been that traumatic if I had such an ""easy time"" talking about it so soon after it happened. Now I am scared that noone will believe me because I didn't talk about it sooner where there still could have been a chance to investigate.

I'm honestly not really sure where I'm going with this, but to those who maybe watched the show, or just based on what I told you about it, I'd like to hear your thoughts on this. Maybe someone was left feeling similarly to me after watching it?"
368,"I'm sorry of I'm not in the right group, I seriously don't know any better one to tell this story in. 

I'm a guy, in a loving and wonderful relationship, and I recently started a new and promising job. I get along swimmingly with everone there, I've worked for several years for that company, but just switched departments. I am happy. Or I would be if it wasn't for her. 

She is a co-worker who will not stop coming on to me. And this is not subtle. I mentioned my cat cuddling with me, she says ""oh, I would also wanna cuddle with you"". She saw me browsing engagement rings, and asked me if I was giving her a ring. I told her I was obviously looking for one for my girlfriend and she hit me with a some papers. ""Playfull"", she said. She never fails to mention how ""I couldn't even imagine whats going on in her head"" and things like that. How much she loves my voice. How pretty she thinks I am. Ever. Fucking. Day. 
I honestly feel unprepared to deal with this. I don't engage her, I mostly just nod and smile and get back to  my job. I like everone who is working there, but I also make a point of being professional. As in no hugs, no ""wrong"" jokes, I mean, it's my job, not a party.  And that's difficult, because she is VERY touchy with me, always laying hands on me and trying to hug me and stuff. I just want to do my job. And I have a girlfriend and she could be my Mom and I just want to work. 
She might switch to another company soon, and hope she does. I'm not saying it's hell, I can deal with it most of the time, but ...I don't know. Sometimes I can't.  Sorry if this is not the right place, I just felt like venting."
369,"The Woman I Was


Last week, my counselor recommended I commence the anniversary of my sexual assault by reimagining, empowering, and reflecting on the woman I was before.¬†


That night, I sat in tears. I found myself lost in frustration at the fact that she, the girl I once was, didn't seem remotely familiar to me anymore.¬†


This past week I have been back and forth on the consideration. The truth is extremely difficult to put into words. Tonight, I find myself restlessly fighting with it, knowing that tomorrow is the day to discuss.¬†


What I've found is not a familiar reflection of the innocent girl I resolved being at the age of 18. I have seen fragments of it, but I also identified a foolish girl walking directly into danger with a naive disposition of the capacity of human beings.¬†


She was trusting, to a fault. Invincibility complex in tow, she led herself into a situation that shattered a lot of dreams; the dreams I once had. She allowed a situation in which I was trapped. She held me in pain for days, months, and years afterwards - reliving the experience.


What I expected to be a beautiful and cathartic reflection of the girl/woman I once knew, unveiled itself as anger and contempt.¬†


Without knowing, I believe my counselor discovered something that I had not considered. Previously I thought I couldn't live past the anger towards those who did it‚Ä¶ but I also had not forthrightly acknowledged the fact that I was ultimately angry at the girl.¬†


I remember the girl: she was on the dean's list and honors society as a sophomore in college. She worked multiple jobs and pushed through full-time classes, while maintaining a debt free degree. She was incredibly intelligent and her true potential shone through the shy exterior‚Ä¶ with, I might add, an incredible sense of humor. (An attribute I still have, but carry with a darker sense of cynicism)


She also didn't expect harm from others. She over invested in empty people. She expected the ""next best thing"" out of everyone she met. She had an adoration for her dog, Lola. She was a go-getter and, in my opinion, quite likeable.¬†


Assault shatters that self-image and rocks your world, turning it upside down. It makes you question everything about life, the value of school, money, work, relationships. All the things that seemed easy and navigable become insufferable.¬†


She was athletic, people from school still talk about how much she ran; miles and miles on the trail, on foot or by bike. She felt safe in her own head, a comforting sense of familiarity that was later to be clouded by self-doubt and disgust.¬†


She would create experiences to embrace life and those in it. She came to the college social scene, from the life of a home schooler, with an enthusiasm and exuberance for others.


Looking back, I wonder what that girl would be like today. Would she have found some sense of life that achieved all of her dreams?


Parts of that story aren't worth wondering about. However, the knowledge of what has created the woman I am today is important to me. The brilliance and beauty that I still have through the hurt and pain and muddied parts of life. Those are the parts worth wondering about.¬†


The experience that girl lived through is exemplary of strength, courage, and resilience. She was drastically changed but also adjusted as those changes took place. Through weakness, she tried to give up. She tried to turn over the rights of her life. She tried to end the pain. Again, she resolved to live on.¬†


Previous to these words, I have published to profoundly capture the strength that women can take from these reckoning experiences. In no way do I disbelieve that women carry on to be better than they were.¬†


Tonight my mind is on empathy for those of you who struggle in the gray fog. The woman or girl who thinks it should be over, or easier by now‚Ä¶ or now‚Ä¶ most certainly NOW?!¬†


Sometimes those lows seem endless. Sometimes the sadness is ok to accept. Sometimes life just IS what it was meant to carry on as: you can do nothing more than accept that fact, take a deep breath, and wait to see what that next moment may hold.¬†


Sometimes, amidst the chaos, those next moments are better. Sometimes you hear the light-hearted laughter that reminds you of the girl you once were. Sometimes you see the smile in the mirror that you recognize of yourself. Sometimes you feel worth more than what your experience dictates.¬†


To women struggling through any of this, to anyone that takes this as blame being placed on them. For me this too is just another moment in time.¬†


I have seen many different faces since that experience: strong, brave, and courageous. Also: weak, frightened, and discouraged. I love all of those faces equally, maybe not in that moment, but it's a learned adaptation of my experience that demands I eventually move through it all‚Ä¶ Even the ugly parts.¬†


To my fellow survivors: we are fearless and strong. We have lived through hell and kept going. There is not any part: sadness, disappointment, anger, fear, or shame that is wrong. You are growing as well as you can for today. Don't ever give up on that truth.¬†


Most important of all: Don't ever give up on you.¬†"
370,"I made a throwaway account just to say this. Not sure if it'll be read but I needed to write this.

When I was 18 I went to a house party with some coworkers. I got really drunk but had 2 friends from work with me so I didn't get worried. But I ended up getting blackout drunk and passed out. When I woke up, throwing up, I could feel that my pants were pulled down and someone was fingering me. I tried to say stop but they just laughed and kept going. I kept on passing out and waking up, and I felt someone raping me. I got the sense that it was more than one person, and I could hear others laughing. Eventually I woke up to someone raping me while I was on my belly, face down. I got a big jolt when I felt it going in my ass and that caused me to scream and wake up for real and luckily they stopped soon after. I don't remember exactly how I got out, but I think my friends came back (apparently they had left to go pick up another friend) and helped me put my shoes on and drove me home. 

I eventually was told by someone who had been there that three guys had raped me, and they had done so after my friends (the only other females at the party) had left. A few of the others had watched, and someone took a video. My friends didn't even know what had happened until I told them. At first I was too embarrassed to tell anyone but my closest friend, but after three days I went to the police. 

The first thing they asked was ""are you sure you didn't just dream it up?"" I assured them that the pain in my ass was no dream. No physical evidence was gathered, as I had taken 2 showers since then and also it had been 3 days. For a time I had hope that I would get some justice for it, but that never happened. Even though some of the guys at the party told others what happened, and I had a text from a guy who told me of the existence of the video and who the three guys were, that wasn't enough. I did a call to one of them while at the police station. The detective thought he might admit to having sex since ""he seemed to like me."" But it just never amounted to anything. Everyone who they talked to who was at the party, including my 2 female friends, denied knowing anything of the sort had happened. Even though one of the female friends  knew exactly what happened, she pretended not to know because she didn't want to admit to underage drinking. 

This happened almost 6 years ago, and I have occasionally called the detective and inquired if anything more could be done. But she stopped picking up 2 years ago. To this day, I am haunted by that night. I could never seem to stop saying what if. What if I hadn't lied to my parents about going out? What if I hadn't drunk so much Bacardi? What if my friends hadn't left? What if I hadn't passed out? I try to explain to myself that rape is the fault of the rapist, and I truly 100% believe that, but it almost feels like that doesn't apply to me. Like it could have been avoided if I had made different decisions that night. Of course, it could have been avoided if the rapists had chosen not to rape, too, so why does it feel like I had a higher burden in preventing it then they had in not doing it? 

This really fucked me up. I'd always been a pessimist, but this just made me constantly angry. I carried around this intense rage all the time and was prone to snapping. The only thing that helped was the passing of time. Life kept moving on, even if I wasn't ready, and it sort of dragged me with it. I did see a trauma counselor for a few months, and I would feel better while I was talking about it with her, but it was only free for a certain amount of time. Once it ""expired"" I couldn't afford further treatment, and that kind of sucked. 

I told a few close friends about the rape and most of their responses were shit. ""Omg you have to be careful, you can't just be partying it up like that"" was one of them. My best friend was extremely supportive about it, and helped me get the courage to go to the cops, which was the right thing to do, even if it didn't get anything done. I avoided telling my two brothers for a few years because they're guys, and it's awkward, and I was worried about how they'd respond. I was right. One day I was arguing with my older brother while my family was all in the room, and he was saying some things that really made me explode, and I snapped, screaming at him ""I was raped you know"" to which he replied, ""I bet you were drunk"". Family is just great. I ran from the room and heard my mother telling him off, and I also heard him reply ""she's trying to manipulate me and it's not going to work""

These days I'm mostly ok. The fact that they got away with it still can make me so angry. I'll admit I often fantasized about getting my own vigilante justice, finding them and torturing them to death.  Even today I feel like I would give so much to be able to feel closure, knowing that at least one of them is paying for it. But I know that rationally it's impossible. So I have to just live with it. Most days I don't think of it, but when I do, it makes me want to hit someone. I hope that time will help dull it more until it no longer makes me feel so intensely. "
371,"Years ago I told my therapist that I went to a party in college and something happened that I‚Äôm not sure I wanted to happen. 

Her follow up questions where ‚Äúdid you say no‚Äù and ‚Äúdid he hold you down?‚Äù and ‚Äúwas he violent?‚Äù

I said ‚Äúno‚Äù to all because I had been completely incapacitated and couldn‚Äôt remember if those things happened or not. 

Then she said that I needed to take responsibility for my role in what happened (implying that it was not assault or rape). 

At the time I just trusted her and spent years trying to fit the pieces I could remember into a narrative that was similar to all the other dumb things I‚Äôve done while drunk. But this one doesn‚Äôt fit (even though part of me really wanted to re-write into something other than what it was). 

Is it worth filing a complaint (just so that it‚Äôs documented and can corroborate other women‚Äôs stories if they had similar experiences with this therapist?)

Her job was to give me a safe place to explore the memories and emotions surrounding that night. So not only did she fail to provide accurate information about sexual assault- but she also failed in her role as a therapist. As much as that night bothers me, this session bothers me more because I paid her to tell me that and I trusted what she said. 

(I can provide more information about the night in college- but since the question is about what happened in my session it didn‚Äôt seem relevant to go into too much detail)"
372,"Hey guys, I just wanted to let you know since I can‚Äôt get it out in the open or tell my parents due to embarrassment or them not believing a guy can not enjoy sexual attention all the time.

I‚Äôm the tallest of my grade (roughly 6‚Äô5‚Äù) and I wouldn‚Äôt call myself drop dead gorgeous but I‚Äôm not deprecated in my looks. But unlike my face or personality my butt gets more attention. I guess you could call my ass ‚ÄúThicc‚Äù but I‚Äôm pretty in shape. I get spanked in the hallways, cat called by girls and boys and idk. I don‚Äôt like it but I don‚Äôt care too. 

Honestly just wanted to get this off my chest."
373,"hi. i realized that sexual assult awareness month might bring back some bad memories for some people, and thats ok. if you feel alone, heres my story.
 when i was 8 i was molested by a 15 year old. he was family and the adults sent me to play with him because they needed ""adult time"". i would beg to stay but they pushed me to play with him every time. i was too young to know what was wrong, but i could feel that something was off. 
he continued to take me places like the shed or the woods or the garage. he would tell me that i would ""be his favorite"" if i did what he wanted, and i wanted that more than anything. he would undress me and himself and tell me how to do what he wanted. he would touch me and tell me i wasnt good enough.
 i was clearly uncomfortable and i asked to stop multiple times. sometimes i even blame myself for what happened, even though i know it isnt right. i cant be around any men bigger than me by myself besides my boyfriend because i get so scared of them taking advantage of me. when he dragged me to the shed, woods, garage ect. i would always listen and follow because i looked up to him, but one day i screamed ""stop!"" and ran. 
a year later me and my mom got evicted and i was forced to live with him, but he never did it again. unfortunately i told someone close to me and they recorded me without me knowing. they sent it to my family and they all threatened to sue me and my mother because they didnt believe me, nor did they believe that he could do such a thing. 
later in my life a guy that i thought was my friend came over, brought a knife, and laid on my thighs even after i told him i didnt like it. my next male friend (previous boyfriend) told people (that i didnt know) that i got, in his words, ""raped by my cousin or something"". 
i was disgusted by that and my trust issues spiked. on the bright side, he told my current boyfriend who i love very much before we were dating. he waited for me to be comfortable telling him until he let me know what my ex said. sometimes i feel so lucky knowing that he understood my baggage and past, and he still wanted to date me.
 i never got my justice but i did get peace and friendships and people who love me. this new years i was at a party with some friends. we were in the woods at midnight walking and i was with my boyfriend. suddenly i was overwhelmed by fear and paranoia and i began to shake and cry and i was frozen in place. my boyfriend was holding me and trying to ask what was wrong but all i could manage to say was ""he used to take me to the woods"". he understood and calmed me down.
 sometimes i feel like im healed, but i know i will never fully recover. however, i will always stay strong. the ptsd and extreme depression this gave me will stay but it will not take over me. if you think you are alone, you arent ‚ù§. 
p.s: if the virus is affecting your mental health and everything seems bad right now, it will be ok. please stay safe guys üíï"
