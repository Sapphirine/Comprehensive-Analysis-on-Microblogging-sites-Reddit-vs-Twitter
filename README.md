# Comprehensive-Analysis-on-Microblogging-sites-Reddit-vs-Twitter

## Motivation 

With the ability of one post and tweet to go viral, organizations have to be careful  about what they are portraying in their marketing campaigns and public statements they make. These posts and tweets also have the ability to impact the stock price of an organization.
 
With microblogging sites playing such a huge role, understanding how the two popular microblogging sites - Reddit and Twitter compare with each other in terms of their impact on stock, viral trends and sensitive topics discussion, is important. 

Novelty - Work has been done on predicting the impact of tweets and posts on stock prices, but little work has gone into how these tweets and posts go viral and where people are more free in voicing their opinions. We aim to target these three points in our project.
